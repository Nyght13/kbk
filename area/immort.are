2. Training and getting the lay of the land.
 
From market square in Midgaard, go one south, and three east to the sailor. It is here
you can train your health points or mana, or other stats. Simply type TRAIN there to see
how many training sessions you have and what you are able to spend them on. To Train them
type Train hp..or train mana..etc to improve your stats. Once you are out of trains that
is it..no more. If you have spare practices you can gain convert them. 10 pracs=one train
here. Be careful of spending your practice sessions though, you might need them further
down the road with cabal skills and the like. So you have armor and weapon and are trained.
If you wish to spend your three hours as a protected newbie practicing your skills in
a safe place, three west and three south, and one east of the market square in Midgaard
would be the place to start. This is only able to be accessed by newbies, and the dummy
does not hit that hard, so you will be able to practice parry, dodge..etc in relative
safety. It's also a good place to learn what your skills *actually* do, if you have any
questions on what a certain skill/spell/supplication does try looking to our helpfiles
for an answer. For instance..typing HELP shield will bring up all related topics to 
shields..helpful for newbie paladins. Onward you go! Doing well so far right?

EDESC pageone~
Welcome to the secret book of total POS domination. Count yourself lucky, people have 
killed for this information. Now read on and learn all you need to know.
 
Getting Started:
 
1. Right when you create, your should first type Outfit. This will give you a basic set
of armor to get started. Buying simple newbie weapons, one south and up of the altar in
Mid should be your next stop. At the merchant, type LIST to show his wares..then simply
type BUY Dagger..etc..whichever weapon you wish, or purchase all of them if you want.
Congrats, you now have armor and weapons. Next type PRAC ALL, to practice all your skills,
spells, or sups to 75%. You are now ready to get on with the training. Look at pagetwo.
~
EDESC guide~
A bound book hums with untold wisdom..perhaps looking through these pages will get you
on your way in these terrible lands. Looking at PageOne seems a good idea.

As your eyes travel beyond the steam rising to the air toward the
rose-brambled balcony railing, you notice a well-creased printout
of a poem sitting on a the velvet cushions of a rosewood chair
that has been set so as to see the stark black mountains
from one angle, or the wine-dark sea from another.

Climbing white roses have swarmed over the original marble to obscure
it almost completely.  The air is sweet not with roses, though,
but with Satin's sandalwood perfume.

The ocean is constantly smashing up against the cliffs and rending
huge slabs from it.  The beach is scarcely a beach at all, more a
collection of rough flakes varying in size from a small car to a
small fist.  As the water comes up over the rocks and ebbs back
down, it filters through the spaces and makes an unnerving rattling
sound.

EDESC  print out print-out creased well poem~
This page has been read over so many times that you can barely discern
the words, and in fact with much poring only the following becomes
clear:
        'I know that I am studly - Heck, I'm sexy, cute and cuddly
         And I know that I'm extremely modest too.'

The page it is flipped open to reads:

A sudden blow: the great wings beating still
Above the staggering girl, her thighs carressed
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,
he holds her helpless breast upon his breast.
How can those terrified vague fingers push
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?
And how can body, laid in that white rush,
But feel that strange heart beating where it lies?
A shudder in the loins engenders there
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower
And Agammemnon dead.  Being so caught up,
So mastered by this brute blood of the air,
Did she put on his knowledge with his power
Before his indifferent beak could let her drop?

She has just started the Lady in the Lake:

Gillerain Regal, the Champagne of Perfumes.  It was definitely

summer rain.

A copy of Peter Pan is opened near the end:

What sort of form was Hook showing?  Misguided man though he
was, we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in
the end he stayed true to the traditions of his race.  The
other boys were flying about him now, flouting, scornful; and
as he staggered about the deck striking at them impotently, his
mind was no longer with them; it was slouching in the playing
fields of long ago, or being sent up for good, or watching
the wall-game from a famous wall.  And his shoes were right,
and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his
socks were right.

James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.

         Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me -
         The ever with a frolic welcome took
         The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed
         Free hearts, free foreheads - you and I are old;
         Old age hath yet his honour and the toil
         Death closes all; but something ere the end,
         Some work of noble note, may yet be done,
         Not unbecoming of men that strove with the gods.
         The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;
         The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep
         Moans round with many voices."

        of nature.  It is not my fault.
        If, that is to say, that I am bored with an adventure that has
        claimed my attentions for four mortal months, it is not my fault.
        If, that is to say, my love is equal to your virtue - and that
        is certainly saying a great deal - it is not surprising that
        one should come to the end at the same time as the other.  It
        is not my fault.
        A woman that I love madly now insists that I give you up for
        her.  It is not my fault.
        I quite realize that this is the perfect opportunity to accuse
        me of perjury: but if, where nature has gifted men with no
        more than constancy, she has given women obstinacy, it is
        not my fault.
        Believe this, you should take another lover, even as I take
        another mistress.  This is good, very good advice: if you
        find it bad, it is not my fault.
        Good-bye, my angel.  I took you with pleasure, I leave you
        without regret.  I shall come back perhaps.  Such is life.
        It is not my fault.

NAME   A Sea Cave~
DESCR
You are in a small cave in a cliff next to a deep green sea.  Fine
gold and pink sand blanket the floor.  Shells are scattered and strewn
about.  A blow hole in the roof of the cave allows beams of light to stream
in and illuminate the cave.  The wind blows outside the entrance, but
you are protected from the weather in your cozy cave.  The foamy surf
never seems to quite reach your feet.  Several boulders here have been
worn by time into a shape similar to a comfortable chair.

This well-lit room is absolutely filled with clutter -- enchanting gear,

and countless other tools of the magical trade, all jumbled together with
seemingly no attention paid to organization.  You have no doubts that Alander

barred to the south, to discourage idle visitors, and Alander's quarters

The scene lain before you is one that gives you the feeling of being placed
under a higher authority.  The jury is out.  A statue of Pontius Pilate is
in the aft of the Arena.  Staring balefully, the statue faces a distant
hillside where many aged crosses still stand.  The Arena is set in a wide
pit-like field of trampled bloodstained grass, and is guarded by high walls
of veinous marble.  A bloodstone seat awaits the true paragon of Romanity.
