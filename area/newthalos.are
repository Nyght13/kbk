DESCR
You have entered the Sultan's private gardens. A light sweat breaks out
on your skin from the humidity here. All around you are thousands of
exotic plants and flowers. The sweet smell of jasmine and honeysuckle
reminds you of happier days at home. Off to the north, through the palm
trees, you see a delicate white gazebo. To your right stands a gold sign.
A path leads out into the hallway and west towards the gazebo.

NAME   Saska's Library~
DESCR
Fine, golden dust swirls and then settles as you enter Saska's
library. Leatherbound volumes of Shakespeare rest next to paperbacks by
Tom Robbins, and Toni Morrison's _Sula_ is open on the striking table: an
antique birdbath of polished blond wood, with glass set over the waterwell
to give the appearance of a perfectly still pool.  Trinkets, lightly
lifted from the mantles of the wealthy whose chimneys she cleaned, line
the windowsills and create space between the different sections of books.
A crystal oil lamp seems to float on the table; a piece of paper on the
wall, written in Saska's own lingering script, reads: "For what is your friend
that you would seek him with hours to kill?  Seek him always with hours to
live.  --Kahlil Gibran."
    A cat purrs somewhere, though you cannot see the source, and you feel
yourself tugged into the softened space. Have a seat in one of the enormous
papasan chairs, and choose a title that strikes you.
