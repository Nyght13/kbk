as sacrifices to provide the pure blood needed to help raise and evil of total
corruption and unspeakable power that lay dormant beneath the city. Thie red
bloodletting was to be accompanied by two other merging powers, that of the
pure magics, the blue energies, and the divine magics, green energies. Yet
something went wrong and now forces of darkness are fighting for the last
keys to the power that lies hidden. Once the red, blue and green are finally
joined the black tower will reveal it's secrets..
