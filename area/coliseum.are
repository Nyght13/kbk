NAME   Below the Coliseum~
DESCR
You are in a small, dusty room.  Crude mechanical objects and
tools lay about, and a thick red liquid drips through the
floorboards above you. However, you feel strangely safe.

Bright light comes from above, accompanied by loud sounds,
almost like yelling and screaming.

A rusty plaque stands here, and a map is nailed to the wall.

================== WELCOME TO THE COLISEUM ==================
You have entered the elite fighting ground of the realms.  Do
NOT attack anybody until an Immortal explains things. This is
considered an irritating annoyance, and you will be slain.

Here, Immortals will watch your killing prowess.  Fight well,
for you may be considered for tattoos, quest items, or more.

You are to stay in this arena until an Immortal transfers you
out.  If you must quit, get the attention of an Immortal.

You may find pills of health.  Use them, for you will need
them. Do not hoard them, or take all of them at once. Slaying
violators is always fun.

Good luck.
--Dioxide
