NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
You stand at a four-way intersection.  Scanning about, you see that
every direction appears to be exactly the same as all the other
directions.  The wide paths are cast in perpetual shadow as thorn
bushes tower above, as far as the eye can see.  The razor-sharp
thorns are coated in a deadly venom and you can see that to touch
them even slightly would be fatal, making passage through them
virtually impossible.  A large sign catches your attention!

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
You stare about you in dismay, you feel like you are standing in
the exact place you just left.  Everything looks exactly the same.
Wondering how this could be, you scan about hoping to see something
that distinguishes itself from everything else.  Nothing pops out
at you and you begin to wonder if you will ever find the exit or,
a more likely possibility, be lost in here forever.

Standing perfectly centered in the middle of the interesction is a tall
barrel, finely crafted in washed oak.  Upon closer inspection you notice
that it is full of crisp, cool rainwater.  A silver dipper is hooked to
the rim for any who wish to take a drink.  You wonder what divine hand
reached down and put this generous reprieve in such an unfriendly place.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
All about, the sounds of laugther and talk can be heard.  This is
quite surprising as the thorn bushes are extremely dense and
should be blocking the surrounding sounds.  You look about to see
where the sounds are coming from and see an occasional scuff
mark marring the lawn covered path.  Aside from these few marks,
the grass is perfectly tended by someone who obviously takes great
pride in his work.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
You are taken by surprise when you notice and exquisitely sculpted
flower nestled amonst the poisonous thorns.  The petals range in
colors from the deepest purples to the palest yellows.  You wonder
how such a flower could grow in such a deadly place.  Then you
take a second look at it.  Maybe, at long last, you have found
something to help you figure out where you are.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
You begin to feel dizzy as you look about.  Nothing changes.
Everything looks the same.  You begin to wonder if you are going
crazy.  You consider asking for directions, but no one looks very
friendly.  Everyone is too busy doing other things to give you
the time of day, let alone tell you how to leave seemingly exitless
maze.  You wonder which direction you should go next, of if you
should even bother to continue on.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
Clustered in a tight circle near the edge of the thorn bushes,
similar to a faerie ring, grows a patch of brilliantly colored
blue mushrooms.  Dotted in lighter colored blue spots, they
look very tempting.  You consider tasting one, but wonder if
they too, like the thorns they grow near, are poisonous,
especially as they seem so out of place in this perfectly
manicured labyrinth.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
An unnatural green light shines down over the hedges, casting
grotesque shadows along the pathway.  You look about trying
to see where it is coming from, but like everything else in
this maze, you can't find anything.  You glance more closely
at the shadows and notice that the thorns create the appearance
of rows of razor-sharp teeth readying to tear your flesh to
pieces.  Although you know this is an illusion, you hurry
onward.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
Completely enshrouding the carpeted pathways, a dark, swirling
mist hovers just above the ground here.  You step carefully into
it and shudder as it engulfs your lower body.  It wraps around
you, caressing your body with its darkness.  You can't quite be
sure, but it almost feels alive.  You hurry through it, not quite
caring which direction you go, just anywhere away from it, even
if that means becoming more lost.

You stand at a four-way intersection.  Scanning about, you see that
every direction appears to be exactly the same as all the other
directions.  The wide paths are cast in perpetual shadow as thorn
bushes tower above, as far as the eye can see.  The razor-sharp
thorns are coated in a deadly venom and you can see that to touch
them even slightly would be fatal, making passage through them
virtually impossible.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
You are taken by surprise when you notice and exquisitely sculpted
flower nestled amonst the poisonous thorns.  The petals range in
colors from the deepest purples to the palest yellows.  You wonder
how such a flower could grow in such a deadly place.  Then you
take a second look at it.  Maybe, at long last, you have found
something to help you figure out where you are.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
You begin to feel dizzy as you look about.  Nothing changes.
Everything looks the same.  You begin to wonder if you are going
crazy.  You consider asking for directions, but no one looks very
friendly.  Everyone is too busy doing other things to give you
the time of day, let alone tell you how to leave seemingly exitless
maze.  You wonder which direction you should go next, of if you
should even bother to continue on.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
Clustered in a tight circle near the edge of the thorn bushes,
similar to a faerie ring, grows a patch of brilliantly colored
blue mushrooms.  Dotted in lighter colored blue spots, they
look very tempting.  You consider tasting one, but wonder if
they too, like the thorns they grow near, are poisonous,
especially as they seem so out of place in this perfectly
manicured labyrinth.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
An unnatural green light shines down over the hedges, casting
grotesque shadows along the pathway.  You look about trying
to see where it is coming from, but like everything else in
this maze, you can't find anything.  You glance more closely
at the shadows and notice that the thorns create the appearance
of rows of razor-sharp teeth readying to tear your flesh to
pieces.  Although you know this is an illusion, you hurry
onward.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
Completely enshrouding the carpeted pathways, a dark, swirling
mist hovers just above the ground here.  You step carefully into
it and shudder as it engulfs your lower body.  It wraps around
you, caressing your body with its darkness.  You can't quite be
sure, but it almost feels alive.  You hurry through it, not quite
caring which direction you go, just anywhere away from it, even
if that means becoming more lost.

DESCR
You stand at a four-way intersection.  Scanning about, you see that
every direction appears to be exactly the same as all the other
directions.  The wide paths are cast in perpetual shadow as thorn
bushes tower above, as far as the eye can see.  The razor-sharp
thorns are coated in a deadly venom and you can see that to touch
them even slightly would be fatal, making passage through them
virtually impossible.

it and shudder as it engulfs your lower body.  It wraps around
you, caressing your body with its darkness.  You can't quite be
sure, but it almost feels alive.  You hurry through it, not quite
caring which direction you go, just anywhere away from it, even
if that means becoming more lost.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
Lost and without hope of finding your way out, you stand in the
middle of the intersection trying to figure out which way you
should go next.  You face north, east, south, then west,
scratching your head in utter bewilderment.  You step toward the
north, then change your mind and start heading south.  You stop
again and mutter irritably to yourself.  Which way to go?

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
You stand at a four-way intersection.  Scanning about, you see that
every direction appears to be exactly the same as all the other
directions.  The wide paths are cast in perpetual shadow as thorn
bushes tower above, as far as the eye can see.  The razor-sharp
thorns are coated in a deadly venom and you can see that to touch
them even slightly would be fatal, making passage through them
virtually impossible.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
You stare about you in dismay, you feel like you are standing in

Wondering how this could be, you scan about hoping to see something
that distinguishes itself from everything else.  Nothing pops out
at you and you begin to wonder if you will ever find the exit or,
a more likely possibility, be lost in here forever.

Standing perfectly centered in the middle of the interesction is a tall

the rim for any who wish to take a drink.  You wonder what divine hand
reached down and put this generous reprieve in such an unfriendly place.

All about, the sounds of laugther and talk can be heard.  This is
quite surprising as the thorn bushes are extremely dense and
should be blocking the surrounding sounds.  You look about to see
where the sounds are coming from and see an occasional scuff
mark marring the lawn covered path.  Aside from these few marks,
the grass is perfectly tended by someone who obviously takes great
pride in his work.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
You are taken by surprise when you notice and exquisitely sculpted
flower nestled amonst the poisonous thorns.  The petals range in
colors from the deepest purples to the palest yellows.  You wonder
how such a flower could grow in such a deadly place.  Then you
take a second look at it.  Maybe, at long last, you have found
something to help you figure out where you are.

You begin to feel dizzy as you look about.  Nothing changes.
Everything looks the same.  You begin to wonder if you are going
crazy.  You consider asking for directions, but no one looks very
friendly.  Everyone is too busy doing other things to give you
the time of day, let alone tell you how to leave seemingly exitless
maze.  You wonder which direction you should go next, of if you
should even bother to continue on.

NAME   A Four-Way Junction~
DESCR
Clustered in a tight circle near the edge of the thorn bushes,
similar to a faerie ring, grows a patch of brilliantly colored
blue mushrooms.  Dotted in lighter colored blue spots, they
look very tempting.  You consider tasting one, but wonder if
they too, like the thorns they grow near, are poisonous,
especially as they seem so out of place in this perfectly
manicured labyrinth.

DESCR
An unnatural green light shines down over the hedges, casting
grotesque shadows along the pathway.  You look about trying
to see where it is coming from, but like everything else in
this maze, you can't find anything.  You glance more closely
at the shadows and notice that the thorns create the appearance
of rows of razor-sharp teeth readying to tear your flesh to
pieces.  Although you know this is an illusion, you hurry
onward.

NAME   The Cell~
DESCR
The Commander's favorite place, this cell is used for any foolish
enough to cross his path.  Completely austure, not even a chair
graces the room.  The walls, floor and ceiling are painted the
dullest of greys, and the doors, facing south, east and west have
no latch of any kind.  Although they stand open when not in use,
for any who wish to pass through, they work on a spring, timing
mechanism when the Commander has locked someone in.  If he had to
let them out himself, they would find themselves rotting in there
permanently.
