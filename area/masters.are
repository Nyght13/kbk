NAME   A Shimmering Portal - The Pinnacle~
DESCR
You stand in a rift in time and space, and perhaps reality itself.  Blue,
teal, and purple hues move quickly and chaotically around you in every
direction, and there are no defined walls or ceiling.  Countless cryptic
runes dance in the air about the portal, giving testament to the immense
amount of magical power harnessed by the founders to tear reality itself. 
The air around you vibrates and hums with raw magical energy and the sheer
potency of the magic can be felt in waves through the body.  In the chaos of
this void, the Seneschal, the Tower's most powerful mage, stands watch over
the sacred Orb of Magic and the Tome of Infinity, where the most powerful
spells and magical secrets of the Tower are kept.

NAME   The Tower of the Collective - Third Level~
DESCR
The third level of the Tower of the Collective is the first level where
true sorcerers and magicians are admitted.  Students and other learners are
forced to stay below in the lower levels, as serious study and delving into
the realm of magic begins here.  On this floor, the members of Arcana
further Thera's knowledge and uses of magic.  Tables with massive texts line
the walls of the room, and the center of the room is entirely clear,
intended for the sorcerers to experiment newfound magic.  The library and
lower levels are down a spiral staircase on the eastern side of the room,
while a large staircase leads up through a shimmering portal in the center
of the room.

NAME   The Tower of the Collective - Second Level~
DESCR
The whole circumfrance of this room is lined with bookshelves.  Fellow
students bustle about with books in thier hands reading books on spells and
repeating incantions as they walk about.  Different chairs and couches fill
the center of the room where students can sit and discuss different spells
with one another.  Countless bookshelves adorn this massive room that forms
the second level of the tower.  Students and full-fledged sorcerers alike
find leisure in spending time here, reading books on magic and the history
of the Collective.  Desks fill certain cleared areas of the library and are
all populated to near-capacity by studious magicians, and couches are
comfortably, and conveniently, placed to promote discussion about spells and
knowledge between the library's visitors.  The outer walls retain their
shimmering, glass-like appearance.  A large spiral staircase in the eastern
end of the room leads back down to the first level, while another spiral
staircase on the western end of the room leads upwards to the third level of
the tower.

NAME   The Tower of the Collective - First Level~
DESCR
You stand in the lowest level of the tower, in a room reminiscent of an
indoor courtyard.  The floors are tiled with white marble and what would be
a large circular room is divided into several: some classrooms, and others
practice rooms.  The outer walls are composed of a material similar to
glass, but the tough, ethereal texture hints unnatural forces at work. 
Students of magic and those hoping to one day be found among the tower's
ranks comprise most of the magicians on this level, studying and practicing
their magic.  A large spiral staircase begins on the western end of this
room, leading to the second level, and the tower's exterior is towards the
south.

NAME   Outside the Tower~
DESCR
You stand outside a tower wrought of pure magic.  The outer walls
shimmer similarly to glass and reflect a spectrum of colors when the pulsing
stars in the distance reach their peak brightness.  Near the entrance, large
crystal spires pierce high into the dark sky above.  Mere proximity to the
tower heightens the mind's awareness, and it is obvious that raw power
radiates from the tower and spires themselves.  A rune-covered arch stands
at the entrance to the tower to the north, while the mystical path continues
to the south.

NAME   The Mystical Path~
DESCR
A shimmering arch, made of cyan-colored crystal, stands erect here. 
Pulsing white runes not only cover the sides and top of the gate, but also
float in mid-air about it.  The stars in the distance pulse in coordination
with the runes, making the surrounding light shift repeatedly from
significantly bright to eerily dim.  Past the gate, to the north, a road of
flickering white leads the way through space towards the Tower of the
Eternal Collective.

Bubbling can be heard from all directions in this room.  Here, sorcerers

with magic perform their work.  Laboratories in separate rooms nearby study
the effects of certain concoctions, as well as how to transfer existing
magic to bottles of liquid for the Collective to use.  A man stands behind a
counter, being handed potions by workers and selling them as necessary. 
Towards the north, the main room of the third level can be found.
