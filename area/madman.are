NAME   The train of thought~
DESCR
All around you is a world which doesn't seem to have any normal bounds or
structure. The hallway around you changes constantly. The colors, the 
texture, the lighting, and even the sounds twist and distort before your
very eyes. A long misty essence seems to travel down the path ahead of you.

NAME   A misty vortex~
DESCR
At this point in the path, everything seems to be extremely unstable. Wild
vortexs of colors and random shapes gather around you making it hard for you
to stand still. The ground under your feet seems to feel softer as waves
begin to slowly grow beneath you. The misty essence flowing through the room
seems to branch off in two directions: east and west.

NAME   A set of park benches~
DESCR
This part of the park is somewhat unused from the rest. Grass is slightly
overgrown and weeds are starting to kill the wild flowers. Set in the middle
of all this is a worn out pair of park benches which are currently occupied
by a bitter old couple. Seems they are mad because no one will cut the 
grass.

NAME   The throne of a madman~
DESCR
After stepping into this grove, everything around you changes into nothing
but blackness. You cannot even see the clothes you wear. You say something
aloud and cannot even hear yourself speak. An overwhelming fear grips your
heart as you realize you are in total emptiness. Suddenly a light from in
front of you begins to emanate a red glow bright enough for you to see a
man sitting on a throne made of a large skeleton.
