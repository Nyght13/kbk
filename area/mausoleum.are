SHORT a disgusting, rotting Zombie~
LONG  A horribly disgusting zombie is here, looking to devour the living.
~
DESCR
You can't tell if this was once a man or a woman, or even what race it
once was.... Just that it is horribly decayed, and appears to be
missing a few chunks of flesh, like something else had been eating off
of it.
 The zombie seems oblivious to you, until you draw close enough for it
to make its kill.

slender arm with delicate fingers gripping a dagger ending in an always sharp point.

NAME   Outside of the mausoleum~
DESCR
The skies seem eternally dark and cloudy here, and the stench of
death is almost overpowering as you stand north of the huge grey stone
building. There are numerous heavy footprints in the dirt leading into
and out of this accursed place, along with many deep grooves as if
something heavy has been dragged inside.
You hear a faint howling from within, and sense an occassional rustling
in the graveyard surrounding you. Suddenly, it dawns on you that
entering here may be a very bad idea...
A sign is posted, urging caution.

EDESC  sign~
This area is for high level characters only... 25 to 50+, and most

Once you go in, there may be no coming back alive... you have been
warned.

 To the north is the entryway back to the graveyard, to the south is
the main area of the mausoleum.
 Corpses litter the ground, obviously being dragged here for some vile
purpose. You have an urge to leave this place now.

NAME   A Rakshaka's lair.~
DESCR
The Rakshaka that has taken up residence in this crypt leaves little
by way of personal belongings around. A few polished skulls, a couple of
silver chains, and perhaps a coin or two from a country you have never
heard of.

NAME   A solemn chamber~
DESCR
Despite it's age, the stonework that makes up this chamber is in
fantastic condition, as if it was built yesterday.  The mortar joints are
smooth and flawless that bind the pale grey stones together that form the
walls of this hidden sanctuary.  Dripping candles ooze wax down these
immaculate walls endlessly but near the ground, not a puddle of dried wax
can be seen.  It is if the candles squeeze out waxy tears that evaporate
within this hushed place of rememberance, fading away before your eyes as
the next drip begins.

NAME   Chamber of mourning~
DESCR
Flickering flames of dripping candles bring into view ancient portraits
of a beautiful woman that line every inch of the cold, stone walls.  The
feeling of being in a tomb leaves you and you feel as if you have stepped
into an art gallery devoted to this pristine idol within the paintings.  How
these masterpieces have survived this long within the confines of this musty
place of rest surely must be to magic or even a divine hand.

NAME   Tomb of Tears~
DESCR
A circular room of the same grey stone seems to envelop the only thing of note in this 
chamber. A shimmering ivory statue stands out from the darkness in the middle of the room
carved with loving care upon each hammer and chisel strike to form the awe-inspiring beauty
of the same woman within the portraits above. A vibrant, youth trapped within time, the
statue seems to flicker with life within the stone shell that is now it's prison.

NAME   The Forgotten Tomb~
DESCR
For a tomb below the surface of the earth, the air carries on it the
vibrant scent of freshly bloomed flowers on a spring day.  The sensation of
the warming rays of the sun and the sweet smell quickly fades as wall
sconces burning a dark blue flame bring into view a coffin of granite.  The
lid slightly cracked shows the visage of a corpse of a once striking beauty,
fallen before her time.  Decay and the rotworms have been denied their prize
so far, as the corpse looks fresh, as if only fallen today.  Responsible for
this, is a skeletal hand that waves over her resting form, ivory teeth
chattering in a forgotten tongue to preserve her as she was known to all
that loved her..  And still cherish her.
