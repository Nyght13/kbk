distance. She calls out to you to join her in her dance.

singing a song over and over again and you catch its words... "As I wander'd
the forest The green leaves among I heard a wild flower Singing a song: I
slept in the earth In the silent night I murmur'd my fears And I felt
delight. In the morning I went As rosy as morn To seek for new Joy But I met
with scorn"

Before you is the famed knight of the Order of the Bleeding Hearts, Sir
Sorrow. Famed fighters and honourable men, they have one nagging trait.. All
of them seem full of sorrow and sadness all year round. It's not the sort of
whining self-flagellation type insecurity or self-pity, but a strange and
deep "sorrow" which they all seem burdened with. The Sorrow of God, perhaps?
Nobody really knows save the members of the order.

dressed totally in brown. She wears no cap, her otherwise long hair tied in
a pony-tail.

It's one of the Bard's... "O me! What eyes hath Love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight; Or, if they have, where is my
judgement fled, That censures falsely what they see aright? If that be fair
whereon my false eyes dote, What means the world to say it is not so? If it
be not, then love doth well denote Love's eye is not so true as all men's:
no. How can it? O! How can Love's eye be true, That is so vex'd with
watching and with tears? No marvel then, though I mistake my view; The sun
itself sees not till heaven clears. O cunning love! With tears thou keep'st
me blind, Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find." You feel like

(Parchment: It is yellowed and seems savagely ripped from a tome. "... I
mouthed a prayer for my fallen brother Alandro as I raised his morning-star
to smite the foul witch who had struck him down. But I had reckoned without
her Sisters, and the twain now flew shrieking towards me. The first,
diabolically transformed, pinioned me to the ground, while her corrupt
breath drove the sight from my eyes and caused boils to burst from my skin.
The other, whom I had seen to be beautiful but terrible even as I was made
blind, wrested my weapon from me and tore at my face. I know not how I fled
from their cursed abode, but the relief I felt then at my escape was vainly
felt, for even now, I nightly suffer the torments of their evil
blandishments. In my sleep I see myself being chased at the edge of a black
abyss by the Devil's huntsmen and their hellhounds slavering for my soul. I
wake up drained, I feel both my faith and my sanity slipping from me. We had
been foolishly proud, thinking we could destroy those servants of evil
alone. Now we are undone, and the relic of our Holy Saint is lost forever."

NAME   The Dead Moors~
DESCR
Everything is black here. These bleak moorlands are where the witches
plant the bodies of their victims, where the rotted corpses will rise by
moonlight as soulless pumpkin men. The fetid marsh pools have been the
graves of countless creatures, and the choking stench of death rises from
them.

A lone oak tree stands on the mound, like a beacon of goodness that repels
the evil of the witches.

trees that grow on the banks of the stream cover the bridge in a soft cool
embrace while a breeze flows in from the north. Huge salmon and rainbow
trout weave their way amongst the rocks in the stream below. To the west the
forest stretches on, while the sounds of laughter and play drift in softly

You stand on the eastern end of a finely crafted wooden bridge. It's
edges have small engraved runes carved into them, and the wood is probably a
form of pine or oak from the Emerald Forest itself. Lacking the dull
weathered tone and creaking of most wooden bridges, it spans across a fairly
wide river flowing in a north-south direction. The height of the surrounding
trees provide a pleasant shade from the noon-day sun.

a blurred outline of a small wooden bridge in the distance. Who built that
bridge? And why? Only a few seasoned rangers have ever come this deep into
the enchanted wood, and none ever mentioned the existence of construction of
a bridge. As far as you know, the forest has resisted gently but firmly all
attempts at colonisation or lumbering, which makes it quite a curiousity.

to have gone out of their way (if that is possible) to align themselves, and
the soft wood grass while not having the blunt heads of a kept garden seem
to be growing neatly in line all by themselves. Strong magic is at work

There is something rather peculiar about this part of the Emerald Forest.
A small tombstone sits in the middle of a small clearing. Carved from a
white substance, it's shiny surface reflects what little sunlight that
manages to escape from the umbrella covering of trees surrounding the grave.
Freshly picked flowers lie at the foot of the tombstone, while strange
symbols are lovingly engraved on it. The strange thing is there are no paths
leading from or to the area, which would puzzle even the most observant elf
or ranger. Who would pick flowers for a lone grave and leave no evidence of
passing?

A pile of scrolls sit on a small table, probably pamphlets to be distributed

The silence isn't really eerie, however, but more of a contemplative
quietness. Small stones are arranged in an odd fashion on the ground, much
the way seating chairs would be arranged should the speaker be in the middle
of a circle. It's almost as though a little tribe of beavers just had a
river-dam guild meeting and have left for lunch.

almost musical chitter-chatter fills the air, while the aroma of freshly
baked treats drift in from the north. There seems to be a forest dweller's
competition, what with the many games the pixies and brownies seem to be
playing. A tug of war is currently in progress, with the heaving Brownies
having a slight lead over the grunting Pixies.

ponder things you've put aside, and think on matters you've forgotten.

NAME   Yun Fei Yang's humble abode~
DESCR
You stand in the living room of a small wooden hut. A small partioned
kitchen is to the south of here. The spartan furniture, tidiness and simple
basic furniture hint at the occupier's character. There is a beautiful
painting of a young oriental women dressed in long flowing silk on one of
the walls. Parchments with foreign exotic wordings in flowing black ink
script sit on a desk. A small book catches your eye, it's title being "Zhuge
Liang's Chinese-Theran Dictionary". Some of the scrolls here are written in
a language you can understand.

NAME   The Ruined Monastery~
DESCR
Tangled vines of ivy hang down from what remains of the arch-entranced of
this small monastery. It is ruined beyond repair and seems to have been
abandoned many years ago. There is a quiet and melancholic silence in the
air. You notice footprints in the dust that lead west into a leaf-strewn
courtyard and continue into a small chapel. You notice for the first time
that that area of the monastery seems to have been spared the dereliction
that the rest of the monastery has fallen into.

NAME   The Chapel of Saint Sebastian~
DESCR
You stand within the only standing structure of the once proud Monastery.
Evidently the chapel is looked after for the floors are swept, pews wiped
and the stained-glass windows in good working order. A modest pulpit made of
mahogany with a carved pine cross attached to it faces a few rows of wooden
benches. Probably cared for by questing paladins or clerics on a pilgrimage,
you wonder if any of the faithful might be nearby. To the west wall you see
a hole large enough for you to squeeze through.

NAME   Outside the Wall of the Monastery~
DESCR
You stand in a small clearing outside the west wall of a small chapel
within a monastery. Birdsong fills the air while butterflies yellow and red
flutter about happily. A tall large oak brings shade further west, but all
movement to the north and south is prevented by a combination of trees and
the old stone walls of the monastery. There is a serenity and a sense of
life and peace, hinting that it is often used by others as a place of
worship or contemplation.

NAME   The Dead Moors~
DESCR
Everything is black here. These bleak moorlands are where the witches
plant the bodies of their victims, where the rotted corpses will rise by
moonlight as soulless pumpkin men. The fetid marsh pools have been the
graves of countless creatures, and the choking stench of death rises from
them.

DESCR
You are in the eerie domain of the Weird Sisters. Ghost lights flicker
palely about your feet and cast a shadowed eye on a variety of rotting
plants and animals that cover the forest floor. The twisted thorn trees
groan at your approach, and you are aware of a slow hissing that seems to
taunt you from the cover of darkness. To the south a fog rolls out onto a
dead marsh.

floors and timbered walls gleam in the soft light of several small oil
lamps, polished and waxed. Small ornaments of various shapes and sizes hang
on the walls and bright tapestries drape the rough wooden furniture and
curtained glass windows. Odd pieces of silver and crystal are sitting upon a
long trestled table in the middle of the room. Flowers from the forest, all
cut and arranged blossom from various vases and clay pots. The whole cottage
looks bright and cheerful even with nightfall. Obviously, someone with good
tastes lives here!

NAME   Iuppiter's Bedroom~
DESCR
You walk into a much smaller room filled with sculptures instead of small
ornaments: over a hundred of them, lining the walls in holographic niches as
well as scattered around the floor on ornate pedestals. The variety, as you
have come to expect, is astonishing, ranging from human-style chunks of
simple stone and wood to others that were more like tethered living
creatures than works of art. Each is illuminated by a flaming blood candle,
giving a sharp contrast to the darkness around. You can barely make out a
huge bed that lies in the northeast corner of this gloomy room. Several
other portals seem to lead out of this room. You wonder where they may lead
to...
