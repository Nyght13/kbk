dark they seem to swallow the light around them, seeming to reel and bubble

creatures that could easily kill a dozen heavily armed Bordermen, creatures
created by the Dark One to watch over his land.

You now ride along the bases of the Seven Towers, once the kingdom of

lands to the south.  It's power now broken the Towers are in ruins, lying on
top of the foothills leading to the Mountains of Dhoom, all but two are utterly
destroyed, the two standing towers are to the east and west.  The taint of the
Shadow is much heavier now, you feel the evil now living in Malkeri. All the
trees and plants in this area are only barely holding on, decay taking them as
quickly as they grow.  Waves roll along the Hundred Lakes, and hope is far
away.

NAME   Entering the Blight~
DESCR
The corrupted trees of the Blight sway in the wind, leaves and branches
seeming to grab at you as you pass by them.  Your nightmares seem like fanciful
daydreams compared to the evil that has siezed this land.  Only fools and
highly trained Warders enter this far into the Blight, and even the Warders
deadly skills are sometimes not enough to keep them alive.

disturbing of all.  You are standing on the shore of the Dead Sea.  It's black
and lifeless waters are perfectly still like a huge mirror of pollished
obsidian.  It's calm and lack of life chill you to the bone, surely one step

NAME   By the Shore~
DESCR
A grotesque and disturbing site meets you eyes here.  The Blight still
surrounds you all of it's death and decay strong in your mind.  But, what lies
to the west is perhaps the most disturbing of all.  You are standing on the
shore of the Dead Sea.  It's black and lifeless waters are perfectly still like
a huge mirror of pollished obsidian.  It's calm and lack of life chill you to
the bone, surely one step into those evil waters would mean your death.
