An ancient elf clothed in simple robes which have been ravaged by time.
Tangled grey hair cascades down upon his shoulders, adding to his
discheveled appearance. He looks about with a distant look in his eyes.
You notice a large lion has been embroidered on the back of his robe.

The walls here are made of some form of smooth metal. A strange glow
seems to emanate from the walls themselves, giving light to the halls. The
air is heavy with age, and the absolute silence of these halls is
devastating. An inch of dust covers the floor , and the eyes of a thousand
years seems to bear down on you.
