you.

As the skeleton turns to look at you, a feeling of impending doom fills

and Takhisis' evil intentions. The skeleton is black as night, and the sword
it clutches is rusted and jagged. An undead, unholy red glow fills the
skull's eyesockets as it realizes that you can be corrupted just as it was.

fills you with fear.

undeath ... But he failed. Now he is what he hated, a monster, victim of a
curse strong enough to last until the High God comes to either prevent the
destruction of Krynn ... Or to do it himself.

The minotaur is rotting and decaying, hunks of raw flesh gone from
bulging arms and legs, fur stripped away to reveal maggots devouring the
rotting flesh, an odor so rank you can barely stand it. The minotaur towers
above you, nine feet tall, brandishing a club as thick as one of its arms.
In its eyes burns undead evil, a red fire welling up deep inside it. As it
shifts its arms to raise its club, part of its tunic falls away, and you see
maggots writhing inside, falling onto the floor along with rotten black
gore, spattering onto you, releasing an odor so foul you want to vomit.

NAME  dracolich huge mount red~
SHORT a huge red dracolich~
LONG  (Black Aura) A hulking lich-dragon towers above you, wings beating slowly. 
~
DESCR
The dracolich is surrounded by a perpetual black aura of hatred and evil.
It is outfitted in black battle armor, the kind that dragonriders use for
their mounts. On the breast of the armor is the signet of Dargaard Keep, and
that can only mean that this enormous red beast is Lord Soth's personal
mount, to ride into battle and to bring about more death, more loss of life.
As it sees you, the dragon opens wide its mouth and hisses, blasting the
room with hot, putrid breath. This contrasts sharply with the horrid chill
that radiates from its body.

The creature ... A nightgaunt, something conjured out of blackest horror
and fear. It is oily and smooth, covered with thick, rubbery black hide and
has two large horns on its head, stretching outwardss and curving back in.
Its wings make no noise, its tail lashes needlessly and disturbingly. It
does not speak, it does not even grin, for it has no face, just a blackness
where a face should be. All it does is fly and crush and lash its tail. Such
is its way.

The something appears to be some sort of ghoul, but you can't tell for
certain. It is vaguely humanoid, vaguely canine ... It is something very
foul and odious. The loathsome air around it stinks almost as bad as a
dragon does, but with some sort of difference to it. The creature's hide is
rubbery and unpleasant, covering a body that slumps forward, and has two
arms ending in sharp claws, all topped with a dog-like head full of sharp,
jagged incisors. It walks about on hoof-feet, something very odd ... There
is something decidedly unnatural about the beast, whatever it may be.

fog and mist blankets the ground, condensing on your armor, chilling you
more than it should. It is, after all, just mist. Maybe there's a place that
you can rest up ahead. Back west lie the mountains.

You stand before a mighty fortress of cold, hard grey stone. A feeling of
dread and chill overtakes you upon looking at its tall spires and high
fortifications. A large wooden door is the only visible entrance into this
keep. Wind howls all about, cold wind mixed with cold rain. It beats on your
skin mercilessly. Overhead, the sky darkens and thunder rolls in the
distance. And you notice that there are very few footprints in the dusty
soil of the Vingaard mountains here; only deep, heavy impressions in the
ground and some fairly gaunt-looking steps, as if a creature with bony feet
walked here. Back west, the trail through the Vingaard mountains goes back
to what feels much safer.

Horror. Destruction. Hate. Nothing else can shove its way into your mind.
This is Dargaard Keep, or it was. How long has it stood undiscovered? Cries
echo across the ruins. They sound unearthly and undead, and you get the
distinct feeling that he is here ... Lord Soth. Damned by his elven wife as
the Cataclysm struck Krynn to wander the realm in an eternal, dreadful life
in this very place ... The man who was once the bravest and most honorable
Solamnic Knight, now cursed to unlife until Krynn is destroyed again. To the
west, regardless of what may be there, it is much safer, in the Vingaard
mountains, even in the dark. Up here, nobody can hear you scream. Nobody can
come help you. Nobody will find your body. Up here all alone, let alone in
the dark.

Or are they doing that on their own? The darkness overwhelms you when you
look at one of them, lancing your eyes and stabbing into your skull. Back
west, where it's safe, no matter what lies there, is the Vingaard mountain
range. North, south and east, the halls stretch on, stretching on when you

an unnatural coldness; it is like the coldness of death. Cries echo through
the ruins of the stone keep. They sound sad and mournful, singing a
terrifyingly beautiful song in an elven voice. The hall looms on to the

replaced by a mist that takes no notice of the solidarity of the world or of

that is restless and wandering about for no reason other than to keep moving
at all costs. From in the shadows it crawls, and in the shadows it finds a
way to go where it wants to go. To the west the passage extends, trying not
to collapse under the psychic emotional pressure that forces it to stand
beyond time, beyond life, beyond anything that is natural and good. And down
lies the first floor, down lies the fog that clutches to your legs like a
small lost child.

done by an artist well-known in his time. No windows are in this hall, no

This is a dreamscape, something not real, something time should have
forgotten about but couldn't. Bolted footsteps seem to follow you, but
nothing is there to see, nothing is there to make those sounds of pensive
walking and pondering. Life is just a dream of the waking, a dream long
forgotten about in these halls of madness and sorrow. Mists wrap around
nothing, float in some sort of twisted purpose through the air and through
the silent stony walls of the hall. To the south lies the rest of this wing
of the keep, and to the north is another hallway of dreams altogether.

In this hallway, screams echo too loudly, footsteps echo too near to you.
Things seem too loud to be real, things are too mysterious and intangible to
be here. There is no life save your own, no breathing but yours, nothing
here that would make anything comfortable. Darkness settles in and makes its
home here, mists trail through the air and through the walls. Great sadness
and pain assail your mind, burning an image of lost love, of lost goodness
and light. Torches burn blue, burning without heat or purpose other than to
give an inkling of what life once was. South, another wing of the keep
extends, and north is the rest of this part.

On this stone balcony, with the cold air all around you and the sky
growing dark with night, you feel somehow at peace. A haunting song echoes
in the distance somewhere, a song sung by elven voices to Lord Soth. You can
see most of the Vingaard mountains from here, and looking straight down, you
can see the main gate of the keep. You might even be able to jump down
there; it can't be more than a 15 foot fall. Back east, the keep reaches on,
cold and dark. And somewhere, the undead elven maidens sing to Lord Soth all
night long.

NAME   Third floor landing~
DESCR
Choices overwhelm you here, just like the overwhelming feel of hate on
this, the third floor. North, south, east and west lie cold stone hallways,
up and down lie imposingly wide staircases that lead to old places consumed
by old tradition and the pain of a time when something good dwelled here.
Now there is nothing ... Nothing. Only memories of a warm hearth, of life
and love that cannot exist here anymore. They were forced out when death and
corruption were forced in. It doesn't take much to rip the air, thick as it
is with a cramped longing for a glimpse of the grand bastion of light that
it once was.

NAME   Northern hallway~
DESCR
You are north of the center of the floor, where halls converge and then
split apart again. Energies seem to streak through the halls here, strange
mists materialize and dissipate before you can focus your eyes on them. The
mists sometimes have faces in them, faces of horror and pain and screaming
agony. The walls have the same emotions, the same feelings; they were never
allowed to fall during the Cataclysm, but were forced to stand and become
something that they shouldn't have been. Nothing is right; the hallways
seems to almost rotate and twist before your eyes, but when you blink, all
is right again for a time.

NAME   Southern hallway~
DESCR
Just south of the main vortex of halls that span this level of Dargaard
Keep, the walls are blank, the floor is blank, and there is nothing but a
few torches to light the halls and bathe it in cold blue light. Behind you
something walks, but you cannot see it. You are being trailed by something
behind you. The sadness thick in the air burns it, chilling it as it slides
down your throat with every inhale that you take. It chokes you, forcing you
to fight for your own life even when you are not fighting. No one dared, no
one cared to tell the keep that it had to stand after the Cataclysm, that it
had to stay and be something twisted and evil. And so it still stands.

NAME   Western hallway~
DESCR
In this short hallway, you get a feeling of more comfort than you have
felt in the rest of the keep, but it is still hateful towards you and it
decidedly wants you to leave now. Here, you get the feeling that the Keep
itself is alive, given life by the intensely evil presence that occupies it.
Rather, perhaps the Keep is undead, like all that is inside it. Regardless,
you are unwanted and despised. The Keep is a mystery of time and of the
realm, something filled with knowledge held only by Gilean.

NAME   Between two oaken doors~
DESCR
You are between two large doors of thick oak, one north and one south.
The hallway is back to the east. This area of the keep feels more
comfortable for some reason; it feels lived in. That's the only real way to
describe it; not as much ill will and hatred is here as compared to the rest
of the Keep. But still, something is wrong, something is terribly hateful
and discordiant. The spirits of the old seem to be pushing you away because
you are something alive and you have that spark of life in you, and that is
something that is foreign, fearful and unwanted here.

There is somewhat of an aura of comfort surrounding these stone walls,
but the evil mists still drift through them and choke the air and your
throat with their presence. They get trapped there, and don't want to leave
until you force them out with your breath. It is almost as if the mists were
some sort of tangible emotion of hate and despise. Life like your own is
something foreign here, just as the undead are foreign to the common
citizens of Palanthas. Shrieks echo in the night that is eternal here,
thunder somehow shakes the foundations of the stone walls and echoes through
them, flickering the blue light of the torches that gives no heat, no
comfort.

NAME   Before a large oak door~
DESCR
To the east is a large doorway, filled with a thick oaken door. The rest
of the hallway stretches out to the west. When compared to the rest of the
Keep, this hallway almost feels comfortable. Severe regret and pain emanate
from the east, from behind the large oaken door. And when compared to the
rest of the Keep, it almost doesn't register with you at all, since it feels
so much less worse here. But lest you forget, you are in the fortress of the
eternally damned Lord Soth, who commands an army of the undead. And you are
alive, which is more odious than anything else to the inhabitants of this
bastion of hate and death.

NAME   The master bedroom~
DESCR
The bedroom is large and filled with a musty odor of decay. The fog that
soaks the first floor is here now, somehow flowing inside the room but not
out of the door. It latches onto you, weighing you down and wanting to drag
you into the floor and crush you from the ankles up, grinding you until you
are nothing more than a mass of bone and gore on the floor, energies of
death to be sucked up by the mist and reinforce the powers of Dargaard Keep
and of Lord Soth. Comfort would be here were it not for the mist that hates
you so, it is something alien and not of this world, somehow stemming from
the Abyss to this realm but not back again.

Inside this grey dining hall, one that used to be draped with fine
tapestries and banners of the Knights of Solamnia, you get the feeling of
nostalgia, then hate. The old wooden table still stretches down most of the
length of this great hall, and it is still set with silver plates, goblets,
candelabras, and utensils. What used to be the finest linen is used as a
tablecloth. Now, there's no telling what kind of feasts are held here, or
what is drunk from those fine silver goblets. A chill fills the air and
flows all around you. The mist present in the main hall isn't as thick as it
is here.

The mist is still missing from the fourth floor of the Keep. The halls
echo strange voices in the night, strange faces by the day. It is as a dream
that never ends, a dream that you can't wake up from. The undead citizens of
this fortress all roam about in the same manner, all convinced that they are
merely dreaming and that you are but a figure in the dream, perhaps sharing
the same dream. Below you, the stairwell is dark, but to the east and west,
the now-familiar blue-white glow of the cold torches lights the halls and
shadows things in a way that doesn't seem quite right. And all about, the
same elven song travels lightly on the dark air.

Just east of the waiting hall lies this staircase, so long that you
cannot see the top of it. Thick fog rolls down it, like some sort of twisted
waterfall, cold and evil, glowing with an unearthly white light and further
illuminated by the blue glow of the torches that line the halls and give no
warmth, just light. A heavy, resonant moaning can be heard from up above,
but no sign is here as to its source. The entire stairwell is dark, and the
light only penetrates a few feet up the staircase. A feeling of evil washes
over the room as silence falls suddenly, as a portent of doom like the
flaming mountain cast down upon the city of Istar.

All is dark, and you can see nothing above or below. No torches line
these walls, no heat is felt here. The temperature causes your breath to
crystallize heavily on the air and fall to the floor to be joined with the
thick fog that rolls down the staircase and up your legs, tendrils of it
grasping at anything that it can latch onto. It seems to not be inhibited by
the walls or by you, going right through anything in its way like an evil
nightfall from which the sun will never rise again, in which the three moons
will never be seen. The evil emanations from up above almost grab you by the
neck and throttle the life out of you.

about you, mist rising from the floor only to melt again in the frigid air.
Here especially is the atmosphere fearful and evil, here it is cold and
shivering. And out of the shadows, a pair of eyes watches you, watches your
every move, watches the fear, the cold, the panic in you, in your soul. Your
limbs grow stiff and your entire body is caught in spasms of quaking of
cold. There is but a single torch above the doorway to the east, causing
shadows to flicker about uncontrollably.

story will never be told, will never be known except by the gods and by
Soth, none of whom are speaking about this dark chapter in the history of
Krynn. The elven song does not echo in these rooms, the footsteps do not
resound in this stone cell. The wind howls menacingly through the window
that is in the room, the window that would have awaken the servants at
sunrise every morning. But now, that does not happen. The sky is an endless

cursed by Soth in anger and rage at his contemptible new state of being. The
story will never be told, will never be known except by the gods and by
Soth, none of whom are speaking about this dark chapter in the history of
Krynn. The elven song does not echo in these rooms, the footsteps do not
resound in this stone cell. The wind howls menacingly through the window
that is in the room, the window that would have awaken the servants at
sunrise every morning. But now, that does not happen. The sky is an endless
dark mass, writhing and boiling above the cursed fearscape of Dargaard Keep.

NAME   Eastern side of the south hall~
DESCR
This side of the hallway is dark and short, almost fearsome in its
claustrophobic tendencies. A door is to the east, the rest of the hall to
the west. This southern part is odd, something not felt anywhere else.
Something here gives you the mental picture of something wrong, something
that should not exist in this realm. The living might well have forgotten
about the evil that dwells here, but time had no choice in the matter. The
stone walls echo with madness and too many memories of the past.

NAME   Inside a small library~
DESCR
This library is sparsely lit and decorated, though it is still beautiful
in design; overall, very spartan. A window shows a glimpse of the outside
world, and a small lamp that is beside the chair gives light to the room,
the same eerie blue light that fills the rest of the halls here. This must
have been one of Lord Soth's favorite rooms when he was alive, as it has a
very comfortable feel to it at times ... However, this is not one of those
times. Now the room is mysteriously colder than the rest of the hallways, as
if you were not wanted here.

NAME   A private study~
DESCR
The study is cold, colder than the majority of the Keep. A window shows a
small look at the outside world, of grey storm clouds boiling overhead and
of black shadows winging about in the cold air. An oak desk is also in the
room, cluttered with a few papers, but most of them are on the floor now,
blown off by the chill wind that pours in through the window. Something here
makes you feel unwanted, something here makes you feel as if you were being
watched.

the mercy of the undead minions that dwell here. Great tapestries line the

no limit on the number of malevolent spirits that can inhabit the space. The

to a dwarf's or a kender's neck. It has no inhibitions as it did, because it
knows somehow that you cannot escape it now and there is no possible way
that you can run to get away from it. The deaths plotted in this room, all
the negative energies and thought engineered over the years have sat and
fermented here, building up over time and culminating in an evil so powerful
that it alone can give power to Lord Soth for centuries to come.

This holy place still retains its holy feel; no fog lies here, forcing no

of something sad is here, the sounds of a forsaken being fill the room with
utter despair and a wondering of why. The door to the hall is in the west
wall, but whatever is sad here wants you to feel its pain and to do
something for it before you leave ...

the wisps of mist and ether drift through here. The door to the rest of the

lie black in it. Below your feet is a stone pathway that leads east into the
courtyard. You hear water gurgling somewhere from within. The chill outdoors
is more natural, since you are very high up in the Dargaard mountains, but
it is still teeming with the feel of death and something else that you can't
define. But still, something is warm here. There are black scorches on the
stone and some of the trees around here.

DESCR
You stand in a clearing ringed by dead trees, their trunks warped and
mutated by the undeath here. The strange white fog is especially thick here.
And in the darkness that exists even during the day, it glows with an
otherworldly aura. You can make out a marble fountain in the center of the
clearing, covered with black moss. The liquid looks dark, but then again, it
is dark outside all of the time. The fountain continues to gurgle, and on
the air you can detect a faint odor of iron. To the south, the rest of the
courtyard exists, and a tall stone wall blocks passage east.

At the southern end of the garden lies this small orchard, with some tall
fruit trees planted amongst what used to be flowers and shrubbery. Now
everything is dead and grey and cold. The translucent mist laps at your
feet, like some sort of living entity that feeds on your lifeforce. It is
thick here. The fruit trees are now twisted and grey, like all the other
trees that are in this courtyard. Their bark doesn't look real, as if it
were an outer casing made by the evil that flows through Dargaard Keep. The
orchard appears to continue on to the east, and the rest of the courtyard is
north.

NAME   In the courtyard~
DESCR
In the cold, dead courtyard that must have once been a beautiful, green
garden, not a sound is to be heard save your own. The song echoes more
faintly here, the footsteps and cries from the ruins are not as evident.
Pain and fear hang heavy in the frigid air, like the translucent white fog
that gives you chills and makes your legs feel heavier than they are. Great
trees rise up, ones that must have been wonderful shade trees in their time.
Now they are leafless and twisted, warped from the undead presence that
pervades every mote of Dargaard Keep. To the east, a great wall rises up out
of the fog, and from behind that wall emanates an evil power greater than
any that you may have met.

NAME   Before a pool of blood~
DESCR
At this alcove of the gardens, which at one time must have been quite
cosy, a high wall stands to the west. And from underneath it, a pool of
blood is trickling. The trees here seem to feed off the foul liquid,
absorbing its energies like they once used to absorb water through their
roots. Perhaps it is through this nourishment that the plants are now
twisted and corrupt. All around, strange sounds echo. To the west, you hear
the sounds of liquid splashing. South, the rest of the courtyard drones on.

NAME   A small orchard~
DESCR
At the southern end of the garden lies this small orchard, with some tall
fruit trees planted amongst what used to be flowers and shrubbery. Now
everything is dead and grey and cold. The translucent mist laps at your
feet, like some sort of living entity that feeds on your lifeforce. It is
thick here. The fruit trees are now twisted and grey, like all the other
trees that are in this courtyard. Their bark doesn't look real, as if it
were an outer casing made by the evil that flows through Dargaard Keep. The
orchard appears to continue on to the west, and the rest of the courtyard is
north.

NAME   Before Lord Soth's Black Throne~
DESCR
Raised up on a platform is a black throne that seems to be the focal
point of the room, the focal point for all the undead legions controlled by
the fallen knight that could not overcome his base selfishness in Krynn's
hour of need. The fog is too thick to breathe, too thick to even think. Some
sort of base survival instinct is in the very air, controlling what you
think and feel at this moment in time. Nothing here can change the feeling
in the Keep, nothing here can match the sheer terror and evil that radiates
from the black throne of Lord Soth.

NAME   In a short, dark hall~
DESCR
Inside this dark passageway, the chill becomes a hundredfold more
pronounced and vicious. Evil intent radiates from the east, and fog lies
thick on the ground like the smoke from burning green wood. It creeps up
your legs and seems to want to pull you down into it, so it can devour you
in its life-sapping essence. There is no light here, all is dark. It is not
just because you are inside; it is because something is absorbing the light.
Something sinister and evil is close, so close you can feel it, and it knows
that you are coming.

NAME   Lord Soth's Private Chamber~
DESCR
Here, at the eastern end of the courtyard behind Dargaard Keep, is Lord
Soth's private chamber. Here he broods during the day, and at night, he
listens to the never-ending song of the undead elven maidens that were
cursed to spent forever with him. His seat is here and his arctic presence
is here, chilling you deep down to the core of your soul, glaring into your
mind with blazing orange eyes, ones that could appear any moment in front of
you, appear with a look and a word of death for you, and with that single
word of power keep you here with him until Krynn is utterly destroyed, keep
you here body and soul.

NAME   The fourth floor of the Keep~
DESCR
The mist is gone from this floor of the Keep. The halls echo strange
screams in the night and the day. It is a dream that never ends, a dream
that you can't wake up from. The undead citizens of this fortress all roam
about in the same manner, all convinced that they are merely dreaming and
that you are but a figure in the dream, perhaps sharing the same dream. This
cruel trick of the mind does much to comfort the souls that are still
trapped in the decaying bodies and rotting corpses. To the east, the
now-familiar blue-white glow of the cold torches lights the halls and
shadows things in a way that doesn't seem quite right. And all about, the
same elven song travels lightly on the dark air. West is a door that is not
very special-looking, but a cold draft comes from under it.

NAME   On a high balcony overlooking the mountains~
DESCR
On this stone balcony, with the cold air all around you and the sky
growing dark with night, you feel somehow at peace. A haunting song echoes
in the distance somewhere, a song sung by elven voices to Lord Soth. You can
see most of the Vingaard mountains from here, and looking straight down, you
can see the main gate of the keep. It is a long fall, one that would be
fatal to you. Back east, the keep reaches on, cold and dark. And somewhere,
the undead elven maidens sing to Lord Soth all night long.
