understanding that almost seem impossible, however somewhere in that depth you
sense a dark foreboding chaos present that sends shivers down your spine.  What
is it you see in his eyes?

NAME   A Blood Stained Hall~
DESCR
You find yourself caught in a moment of morbid fascination as you behold a vast
hall of Polished marble. Bas-reliefs and corded stone sequences dance and frolic
in splendid array around the base of both the floor and ceiling. The decorative
trim is set in pictograms depicting jolly cherubs and harp wielding angels,
seemingly calm and serene. As you gaze to the floor however, your stomach
wretches. A thick sticky trail of old blood streaks the once proud marble floor.
Splatters of blood line the once chaste pillars as pools of dried caked blood
pool about their base. This room has been desecrated in ways only read about in
faerie tale. Streaks of blood paint the cold marble wall, you think you see a
hand print, forever caught upon it.

NAME   A Shadowy Room~
DESCR
A stout wooden perimeter encircles this room. The center area has been dropped
down about a foot and a half with a single step leading down. The lowered floor
seems oddly warm to the touch. Upon close inspection you notice the wood has
been worn to a fine grain, save for the occasional knick and gouge caused by
weapons. A tattered war banner of a forgotten general flaps in a gentle breeze,
mounted on a sturdy iron bar in the northern part of the room. While standing on
the raised perimeter you get the impression that you're in an audience, the view
of the center seems prominent, and functional.

You are in a large room leading to a large golden door to the north. As you
look around you notice that barely discernible in the dankly lit foyer there is a
mural etched into the ceiling with great care.  The floor beneath your feet is
