You stand in the north east corner of the city.  There is an eerie calm here,
muffled echoes bounce off the cavern walls and into your ear.  You can
hear the screams of the slave, the talking of adventurers.  The cavern walls
loom up to the east and north of you.  You light doesn't even illuminate up
to the ceiling.  Darkness surrounds you.  The ground is hard and grey.  The
walls are grey, and glint with wetness.  You wish you could recall to
Midgaard, but alas, that is impossible.

You eyes hurt from trying to pierce the darkness that lies everywhere.  The
ground is rough through your boots.  The air is cool, and the cavern wall to
your west glints with wetness.

A small glowing orb of light is floating a few feet above your head.  The
orb gives out a dim light that barely illuminates everything around you. 
These orbs seem to be along all the streets in the Underdark.  The orb

NAME   The Gathering Place~
DESCR
You are in the north west corner of the gathering place.  It is here that the
denizens of the Underdark come to meet to discuss business.  The lighting
here is dimmer than in most places.  Dark shapes seem to blend in and out
of the shadows.  Somehow the sounds of the city do not invade this place
so it is quiet enough to discuss without shouting.  The square is basically
clear but the dimness makes it impossible to see farther than 10 feet, thus
making it perfect for meetings of a discrete manner.  It seems as if some
orbs have stopped working.

North is the Slaver's Route, the meeting place continues east and south

You are in the south east corner of the gathering place.  There are no lights

your ears only your breathing and the blood gushing through your body. 
Everything seems to be distance, nothing looks real.  You feel isolated
from society as a whole, ignored, worthless.  There is nothing to live for,
people whisper in the shadows, plotting the downfall of the world. 
Nothing can stop it, there is no point.  How can you as an individual make
a difference?  For a moment, these words form in the air "Welcome to the
darkside" you feel empty and drained.  No life stirs within, a chill
threatens to overcome your entire being.

You are in one of the most oppressed regions of the Underdark.  It is here

that stand up for their rights.  The slaves are reduced to animals in this
square.

cavern and thrives in the dark.  Over half the people who live here can see

casting a thin circle of light on the ground.  As with all sections of this
street, this part has been dedicated to a god, Silence.  As soon as you
realise this, you understand why this section of the city is so quiet. A statue
of a githzerai seems to be kneeling to a statue of Silence.

and very capable with mental powers.  This statue is very lifelike, and it's
eyes seem to glow in the weird lighting of the orb.~

This is a statue of the god of agility and speed.  He is dressed totally in a

there is a note that reads

    Silence is both provider and destroyer, to be blessed by him is to           
be blessed indeed.

You take one final look at this impressive almost life like representation of
Silence and notice that it's eyes glow purple and seem to be watching your
every move.

desire by simply buying a slave from the Slave Dealer.
