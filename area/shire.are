The Elven Wizard looks at you in a solemn sort of way.  His gaze seems to

than the oldest man, he seems to have an inner strength which most mortals
cannot overcome.

SHORT the Keeper of the Ring~
LONG  The Keeper of the Ring is here, guarding his treasure jealously.

The Ring Keeper is a rather big but short halfling.  His short stature and
bulbous nose belie his true nature.  An elven sword that glows with a blue
light hangs from his belt, and on his finger you see the One Ring.  Although
usually a halfling of peace, he will fight you to the death if you attempt
to take away that which belongs to him.

NAME   Took Hill~
DESCR
You stand on top of Took Hill, named after the legendary Bandobras Took.
You feel honored to be standing on a hill named after your hero.  From this
vantage point you can see all of shiredom.  You get the feeling that with
one stomp you could eliminate their great city.  You can see the outline of
Midgaard to the far east.  Sounds of joyful celebration are heard from the
fields west of here.  The Brandywine flows by lazily nearby.
