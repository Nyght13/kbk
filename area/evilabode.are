desire to keep you from what lies beyond him, and the gate.

NAME  Black Keeper  Keys~
SHORT the black keeper~
LONG  A shadowy figure dressed in pitch black platemail lunges at you!
~
DESCR
Every inch of this being is covered with a sturdy dark platemail, the only adornment upon
which is a relief of a key on the breastplate. The helm that sits atop his broad shoulders
has been fashioned into the likeness of an open dragon's mouth, and the darkness within
seems to lighten into a vibrant orange glow. This strange sight, makes him resemble more
of a coal burning iron stove than anything else. Though with the wickedly barbed whip
that trails down from his spiked gauntlets, he might put up more of a fight.

wastes away as well as what once must have been fanciful robes now hang in tatters on

full of rotting teeth that slowly mumbles to himself in an unknown language.

~
DESCR
Grossly obese and disgusting in every manner, rolls of fat pour out from his side as he
lounges on his round bed being fed grapes. Leaving nothing to imagination he simply wears
a tiny thong that cuts into his hairy thighs, if that is not vile enough, his chest is
coated with the rotting crumbs of a hundred meals. How this amount of lard shaped like
a man came to this postion is beyond belief, perhaps he is more powerful than he seems.

What could be mistaken as a giant blue statue springs to life as another poor soul comes
to take what is his. A pale blue light flickers from his eyes that matches the platemail
armor that he wears. From his wide waist a jingle of keys can be heard from the keyring
that is securely fastened there. Tiny sparks seem to trail up and down his arms as he
swings an odd stone spear in a menacing crescent that seems to split the air itself.

A haggard man that hasn't seen a drop of water or a bubble of soap in years from the
way he looks and smells. His glassy eyes never leaves the floor, simply watching each speck
of dirt gently getting swept to one side of the room. When all the dirt has been placed
in one corner, he begins the whole process over, moving the entire pile to the furthest
corner from him. It is quite a strange ritual and the practiced strokes of his worn
broom and the wide maniacal grin he wears makes it even creepier.

The gentle tides wash upon this pristine beach of golden sand leaving a foamy residue.
Jagged mountain peaks rise into the sky on either side of the beach only allowing a 
small pass towards the north. While the surroundings are quite beautiful, the air feels
as though it carries something sinister on each breeze.

A steady incline rises from the beach to these hills. A sparse vegetation sprinkles the

from the bluffs creating a twisting passage of loose rubble which gives under each 
footfall. From this distance a great door of onyx can be seen reflecting the few 
shafts of light that creep their way into the pass. Whatever lies north, someone has
taken great care in keeping it away from prying eyes.

An agonizing silence covers this room and any noise made, whether it be the creaking

glow of color creep in from the three hallways that trail off from here. Towards the 
west a faint reddish glow, to the north a pale blue light, and towards the east an 
unsettling darkness clouds the way. The halls in either direction seem to stretch on
forever, all coated in the eerie colors that exude from the walls.

a lone figure standing within a diamond of white chalk upon the ground. Whether it is

A persistant ticking resounds upon the stone walls coming from the multitude of ancient
timepieces that hang from every possible hook on the walls and ceiling. Crude sundials
sit in tiny windows slowly tracking time as a series of crude pendulums swing endlessly
upon wooden bases in the corners of the room. Apparently some monument to the passage
of time this room's most prominent feature is a simple pedestal holding an elaborate
selection of multicolored gems, all of which a thin man hovers over them, watching
intently trying to unravel the mysteries that are within time and the gems.

husks of humanity. They are fed poorly, just enough to keep them alive should the master
desire them again, it is that slight glimmer of hope that shines in some of the girls'
eyes. To be once again desired by an obese monster so they can escape this hell.

NAME   Grey Room~
DESCR
The room looks of a dull grey, it seems as though there once was color 
upon the walls but it has been stripped somehow.. You look up and you can see 
the green of the grass outside, it shimmers and flickers for a moment. You can 
not see anything down and a voice booms within your head " Last chance to
getting out, there is no going back once you go down." You can go south ,
or down.
