throat, missing you by mere inches.

NAME   Purgatory~
DESCR
A large marble reception desk is layed out in a u-shape, spanning
the entire room.  Behind it lies the door of the lost souls.  The
door is carved from an unkown substance by the most highly skilled
craftsman in the realm, a vivid depiction of those lost behind its
walls screaming in agony, their faces contorted beyond recognition,
desperately trying to break free.

NAME   Entrance to the Vice and Sin Casino~
DESCR
As the door of the lost souls slams shut behind you, a wave of fear
passes over you.  You quickly realize you cannot go back the way you
came.  As you stare about you in dismay, you feel sweat beginning to
drench your body, partially from your fear, partially from the almost
unbearable heat.  There is nothing in the room save for a red velvet
carpet leading to a revolving door to the west.  Above the door is a
neon sign that reads, "Welcome to HELL!"

Of pitch black ebony, the stone walkways are just wide enough for
two people to pass each other without falling into the molten lava
pits found on either side.  Occasionally the lava flares upward,
splattering the pathways and burning any who are unfortunate enough
to be walking along where it lands.  Fumes rise up from the pits,
making this otherwise easily transgressible maze nearly impossible
to navigate.
