NAME   A sandy path south of New Thalos~
DESCR
The temperature has suddenly risen drastically and become almost
unbearable.  Towards the north, the vast city of New Thalos stands tall and
majestically.  This path has been artificially constructed towards the south
and is covered in a shallow layer of sand.  The path is lined on both sides
by tall grass.  Lizards and other small creatures scurry across your path
occasionally as you walk about.  Towards the south, a massive desert opens
up and stretches towards the horizon like a vast ocean, while New Thalos's
southern gate lies to the north.  
 
A sign is planted here in the ground, beckoning you.

Towards the south lies the Dunes of Aarid'dorr. This area is more than likely
impossible to muster alone, and only the strongest might survive to see its
treasures.
 
Proceed with great caution.
 
Within this area, there is one room you may recall from, and that is the wooden
bridge in the center of the area.

NAME   The Dunes of Aarid'dorr~
DESCR
The sun has seared this desert plain with relentless fury, preventing the
growth of any plant life.  The sky is illuminated, even at night, as a
result of the sun's burning rays.  Lizards and other small creatures scurry
by occasionally before diving behind rocks and pebbles of sand, hiding from
you and other desert predators.  The wind picks up often, hurling sand into
your face and eyes, stinging and blinding you.  The vast desert stretches
hopelessly out in every direction as far as the eye can see, creating
deceptive illusions of oases and water.

The sun has seared this desert plain with relentless fury, preventing the
growth of any plant life.  The sky is illuminated, even at night, as a
result of the sun's burning rays.  Lizards and other small creatures scurry
by occasionally before diving behind rocks and pebbles of sand, hiding from
you and other desert predators.  The wind picks up often, hurling sand into
your face and eyes, stinging and blinding you.  The vast desert stretches
hopelessly out in every direction as far as the eye can see, creating
deceptive illusions of oases and water.

NAME   Among a number of poorly-crafted tents~
DESCR
You stand in a small gathering of hide tents in the middle of the desert.
The tents are sparsely decorated, smeared only with dull paint and markings.
As the wind blows over the desert, the shoddy hide tents are nearly torn off
the ground and hurled into the air.  The sand has accumulated on the sides
of the tents in large piles and continues to blow frustratingly into your
face.  The vast desert continues in all directions as far as the eye can
see.

The sun has seared this desert plain with relentless fury, preventing the
growth of any plant life.  The sky is illuminated, even at night, as a
result of the sun's burning rays.  Lizards and other small creatures scurry
by occasionally before diving behind rocks and pebbles of sand, hiding from
you and other desert predators.  The wind picks up often, hurling sand into
your face and eyes, stinging and blinding you.  The vast desert stretches
hopelessly out in every direction as far as the eye can see, creating
deceptive illusions of oases and water.

NAME   Among a number of poorly-crafted tents~
DESCR
You stand in a small gathering of hide tents in the middle of the desert.
The tents are sparsely decorated, smeared only with dull paint and markings.
As the wind blows over the desert, the shoddy hide tents are nearly torn off
the ground and hurled into the air.  The sand has accumulated on the sides
of the tents in large piles and continues to blow frustratingly into your
face.  The vast desert continues in all directions as far as the eye can
see.

NAME   A sandy path~
DESCR
A crudely-made path has been made through the sand and mountains here off
the Dunes of Aarid'dorr.  The sand appears to have been pushed aside with a
very large object, causing a wide gap of shallow sand to contrast its
surrounding large hills.  The mountains loom high and ominously on all sides
of the path save west, where the desert lies.  To the east, the path
disappears into a large crevice in one of the mountains.

DESCR
This dirt path strays away from the Dunes of Aarid'dorr into a valley in
the West Aarid'dorr Mountains.  The effects of the sun can still be felt
here in full force, but the ground is composed of dirt, leading you to
believe there is a source of water nearby.  The mountains form blockades to
the north and south, while in the distance to the west, you can almost make
out trees among the mirages.  The central desert lies to the east.

DESCR
You can scarcely believe what you see before you: a small jungle,
supplied with a large pond of water, tucked away in the mountains.  The
temperature here is significantly cooler than the desert, providing comfort
to the weary traveler.  Birds sing carelessly into the wind, worried by
nothing in this hidden paradise.  Shrubs, palm trees, cocunut trees, and a
multitude of other tropical vegetation springs from the ground here,
nourished by the pond.  The cruel desert lies back to the east, while the
mountains surround this lost oasis on all sides.

this place, and you can hear the sound of bats and other cave-dwelling
creatures echoing in the distance from deep within the caverns to the east. 
The cave entrance and walls are extremely jagged to the touch, leading you
to believe that this cave is not man-made.  In the distance amongst all the
noise, you can make out, with some difficulty, the low growling of a
hungered animal.

NAME   The lair of the sand dragon~
DESCR
A gruesome scene: bones, partially-eatern carcasses, and limbs litter
this dead-end in the cave.  The cavern walls suddenly widen into a massive
blood-drenched room, and the sand from the desert appears to have partially
filled the chamber through a hole to the west.  The pressure of the sand,
however, makes travel into the hole impossible.  There is no natural light
here, as in the rest of the cave, and the sounds of bats and other
cave-dwellers continues on, including the low growling of an unknown beast. 
The cavern depths end here, while the retreat back to the entrance lies up
along a steep slope.

DESCR
This slope is much smoother and easier to climb than the slopes anywhere
else on the riverbanks.  Still steep, however, you must walk precariously to
avoid slipping and rolling downwards into the river.  This slope has not
escaped the sun's wrath.  The sands are bleached white, and the heat is no
more merciful here near the river than it is towards the north, where the
vast Dunes lay.  Towards the east, you find yourself able to walk under the
wooden bridge across the river.

NAME   Under a wooden bridge~
DESCR
You stand underneath a wooden bridge, on a small ledge above the flowing
river.  It is considerably cooler here, as the sun cannot reach you.  It
shines brightly towards the east and west, making this place a welcome
retreat from the dangers of the desert.  The water flows calmly, filling the
air with the sound of a tranquil stream.  The slope to return to the desert
lies to the west, and the ledge ends here, blocking all travel in any other
direction.  A piece of paper has entangled itself on a nearby rock and
rustles softly in the wind.  
~
FLAGS  9445376
Sect   10
EDESC  paper~
The piece of paper reads:
 
   "Commander, we have found the ancient relic of great power we have
   sought for so long. The men and I have secured it upon our ship and
   will return it to New Thalos as soon as we can. To prevent thieves
   and pirates from stealing it, we have secured it within our most
   sturdy chest. Picking, bashing, casting, what have you, this chest is
   impossible to open without the key, so you may relieve your mind of
   unnecessary worries."
 
Further down, in a separate entry, the paper reads:
 
   "Commander, while we have secured the relic, the Dragon Sea has grown
   unusually violent. We have been swept southward into a lost ocean and
   have no means of returning to New Thalos, as the only apparent entrance
   is the one through which we came, and the current flows so strongly that
   no boat could ever hope to sail up the rapids. We may be stranded here
   for an indefinite amount of time... we have limited food rations and
   clean water, and while the ocean appears calm, I believe calm waters to be
   the most dangerous for sailors. After studying the currents for some
   time, our men have concluded that all currents here flow westward through
   the mountains, more than likely pouring into the dreaded Dunes of
   Aarid'dorr. In addition, the ship is much too large to fit through such
   a narrow crevice in the mountains."
 
A third entry, written nervously, and evidently a few days later, reads:
 
   "The strong currents in this ocean have rammed the ship into a shallow
   reef. A few of the crew members and I have managed to swim ashore, but
   the ship has disappeared beneath the water's surface, along with the
   relic... We will attempt to recover it after we have determined our --"
 
The writing stops there, and you notice suddenly that the paper is smeared
with blood in some places. Surveying the river and examining upstream,
you notice some wood fragments floating downstream in the water. Apparently,
objects from upstream flow here and end their trek right before you: caught
on the rocks.

You stand upon a wooden bridge connecting the two halves of the Dunes of

intense rays, but is still sturdy enough to support travelers as they cross.
The river runs under the bridge, filling the hot air with the sound of a
tranquil stream.  Towards the north and south, the vast Dunes of Aarid'dorr
thrust out in every direction.

NAME   The Dunes of Aarid'dorr~
DESCR
The sun has seared this desert plain with relentless fury, preventing the
growth of any plant life.  The sky is illuminated, even at night, as a
result of the sun's burning rays.  Lizards and other small creatures scurry
by occasionally before diving behind rocks and pebbles of sand, hiding from
you and other desert predators.  The wind picks up often, hurling sand into
your face and eyes, stinging and blinding you.  The vast desert stretches
hopelessly out in every direction as far as the eye can see, creating
deceptive illusions of oases and water.

NAME   Atop a desert mountain peak~
DESCR
You stand upon one of the higher peaks in the Eastern Aarid'dorr
Mountains.  The hillside is steep, rocky, and highly jagged, making for an
incredibly dangerous trek to climb the mountain face.  From this high
altitude, you can see clearly New Thalos in the distance to the north and
Arkham through the foggy seas to the northeast.  The vast desert is laid out
before you to the west and you can see the West Aarid'dorr Mountains in the
distance.  The only way from this high peak is back down the side of the
mountain.

This pathway has been smoothly cut into the mountains, creating an
artificial pass.  The path becomes more dirt than sand towards the west, and
the temperature has dropped considerably, growing comfortable.  Towards the
east, the vast Dunes of Aarid'dorr open up in all directions, while towards
the west you can see some smoke and hear voices.
