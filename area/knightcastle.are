EDESC  plaque~
THE CODE OF HONOR                         
     1. You will destroy {RALL{x evil. The ONLY exception to this  
        rule is when the evil-hearted truly seeks redemption for   
        his sins.    
               
     2. As the strong-hearted and honorable warriors of Light and  
        Honor, you must uphold the Fortress's values: you may not  
        gang unless the Fortress is directly under assault, and in 
        no instance should you ever full loot your opponent.       
 
     3. You must defend the Code of Honor at all costs, even if you
        must lay down your own life to save it. Without the Code of
        Honor, the Fortress shall fall.                            
       
     4. There are to be no inner conflicts within the ranks of the 
        Fortress. The Leader reserves the right to cast out any    
        Knights he deems unbearably insubordinate or harmful to the
        Fortress's cause. All disputes may be settled within the   
        dueling ring, and ONLY the dueling ring. You have been     
        warned.

has been meticulously placed, hugging the cliffside to the east, to prevent
the accidental fall and eventual death of unwary travelers.  The path
