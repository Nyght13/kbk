DESCR
This being seems to be from the pieces of elven bones that lie scattered all
around the region. It's size is tremendous, easily dwarfing even a giant or
small dragon. There is something extremely evil about it's prescence here at
the blocked river, as if it were the symbol of the darkness that trapped the
doomed elves here in their ships.

You are within the rubbled remains of an ancient city. Plants and weeds have
grown across everything, and much of the time it almost seems as if the
forest is trying to bury the city into the past. There is a lot of wet, damp
puddles of mud in the ground here, almost like a swamp was starting to form.

NAME   Under a broken archway~
DESCR
Above you is a majestic but shattered stone archway. Intricately carved signs
have been cut into it, and fine gems still lie embedded on it's surface. If
ever there was an indication of an abandoned city this is it, gems left here
untouched by even common looters and scavangers that usually haunt ruins. To
the east the ruins open out into a large open space filled with swampish weeds
and wet muddy gorund. In the distant north you can make out the ruins of some
towers.

You are amidst the ruins of the ancient elven city. All around you the stones
have been crushed and scattered, left to erode with time. The greatness that
was once here is long since gone and only the fine delicate stonework gives
any indication of what once was. The ruins wind north towards some towers, or
south to what appears to be a large broken archway.`

NAME   Between the Towers of Passing~
DESCR
You are standing in a large open space that appears almost as if maintained
and kept clear. The rubble and overgrown forest flora seems to have avoided
this region, and the destruction is more subdued here. Three towers lead off
from the square here: a green tinted one to the north, blue tinted to the
east and a blood red one to the west. The rubbled ruins lead southwards
away from here.

tinged with some strange blue colour blocks the way east into the tower.

You stand on a wide but decayed stone bridge. Large portions of the span have
collapsed into the stagnant black waters beneath it, leaving huge holes that
threaten to swallow any who venture too close. To the south the ruins seem
to have become swamped with water and covered in marsh-like flora. North of
here there is a pile of rubbled ruins, most of which is impassable, but a
small section can be seen cleared away to allow some exploration.

NAME   On a dock in a bloody harbour~
DESCR
You are on a collapsed and ruined dock made of rusted steel and decayed wood.
To the south you can see one of the harbours of Myth Drannor, filled with a
shallow blood red water that laps continuosly upon the ruined harbour. The
salty smell of blood fills the air, and there is something powerful and
disturbing about the way the region seems locked in time. It is as if the
bloodshed of the elves were only yesterday and not centuries ago. You can walk
east and west across the docks, or head south into the shallow blood red
waters of the harbour. There is a ruined old boat house to the north.

flesh still hanging off them. It is as if the region were preserved as it
was on the day that the massacres occured. The river heads east where you

boats have been totally demolished and left to rot in the bloody, bone
filled waters. Burnt and blasted hulls litter the entire region, and
skeletons of elves hang lifelessly from the helms and bridges of them.
There is no doubt that the forces that blocked and slayed the elves as
they tried to flee were powerful beyond anything seen in recent times. The
smashed boat graveyard is too hazardous to explore, and you can only head
back south onto the isle of elf bones.
