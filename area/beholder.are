The region of nothingness that this small orb contains is perhaps the most
deadly thing in the universe. Anything touching it is destroyed, but only the
most powerful of archmages can control such power. It is, however, very slow
and it is hard to imagine anything of any reasonable ability being caught by
it unless the user were far superior in ability.

a disgusting smell fills the air. To the east and west you can see that the
corridor heads towards a pair of balconys overlooking the main entrance here.
South of here is a door leading out to the ruins.
