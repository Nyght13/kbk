DESCR
You are walking along a dusty, well-travelled road heading north and
south.  The hard-packed soil makes you think about how much traffic this
place must be getting, and then you wonder about who is making all this dust
and footprints.  Ahead, to the south, you see something dark and massive
looming on the horizon, and closer to you, there is a guard's tent.

So these are the northern city gates of Neraka ...  One look at the
masonry tells you that they were constructed hastily but with great
attention to their strength.  A massive blackened metal gate spans the gap
between the grey stone walls, but it is swung wide open.  To the east and
west, you can see guard towers.  North will take you back to the dusty
trail, and south lies the village itself.

Just inside the northern city limits, you can see it all from here: the
tent city, the thousands of draconians soldiers, the hundreds of Dragons,
and the countless human, goblin, and minotaur mercenaries milling about,
waiting for orders from their commanders.  And in the center of the village,
black and awful, is the Temple of Takhisis.  Whenever someone comes to
Neraka and they see the Temple, it never leaves their mind.

NAME   Main room of the Temple~
DESCR
You stand in the center of the Temple.  All around you, you hear voices
whispering in your mind, whispering sweet seduction.  Monks chant all about
you, and clerics utter their prayers to the Dark Queen.  The stone walls and
floor seem to absorb the light that the black torches are casting from their
sconces on the walls.  And in the center of this room is a massive black
fountain of a headless elf, blood gushing from the neck, carved from the
same stone.  Dark stairwells lead above and below.

from everywhere: the sounds of anguished cries, of cheering soldiers, of
arguing leaders, of chanting monks.  It all blends together too well, too
perfectly.  The massive stone walls surround you, and torches burn brightly
in their sconces.  To the north is the light of the outdoors, and to the

DESCR
You stand inside the Temple.  Now all you can hear in the stillness is
the beating of your heart.  The chants stopped just as soon as you entered
this short corridor.  The north and south walls are just like all the
others, solid black stone, but accentuated with doors.  Faint light can be
detected coming from underneath them, perhaps the burning of a candle. 
There are no torches in this part of the hallway; it plunges into shadows at
about the same place where you ceased to hear the chanting prayers.

of sounds blended into a chaotic song.  Large, silent black oaken doors lead

NAME   Before the Black Altar~
DESCR
You stand before a large altar, surrounded by black-robed mages.  One of
them places a metallic orb in the center of the altar and the mages touch
hands.  As they begin to chant, fear creeps up your spine into your head. 
The chanting continues and the fear grows stronger.  Black bolts of energy
flow from the touching hands of the mages until they all spark and touch the
orb.  Slowly, green-black ooze flows from the orb until it uncurls,
revealing a small glistening lizard-like figure.  It gradually stands and
stretches, the chanting dies off, and the lizard is taken to a room to the
west.  You come to the realization that you have just witnessed the birth of
a draconian.

with energy and evil.  Darkness floats through the room passively, shadowing
the light of the torches and thickening the strange haze that floats all
about.  A great presence can be felt from the north, one that shakes your
soul.

The worry that you will be caught at this point in the Temple is long gone,
replaced by an intense shudder in your body and soul.  Perhaps not fear,
truly ...  More like forced respect.

with magical reagents and other things used for making potions.  This room
does not seem dark and evil at all; it just seems powerful.  The stench of
death does not pervade it.

sit on the table, unlabelled and unused.  This must be where beginners
learn, for almost all of the books are not bound in skin and locked with

iron, but some steel and stolen silver weapons line the walls.  There is
nobody practicing, but a guard keeps watch so that nobody sneaks in and
steals the practice weapons.  The broken altar is back to the south.

There is blood, too, spattered on the floor and walls, the result of battles
to the death, combat where the strong are chosen from the weak ...  And the
survivors are the strong.  Other than that, the room is fairly nondescript,
and looks like the rest of the Temple compound.  To the north is the broken
altar.

This room is a treasure trove at first glance, but as you look closer,
you realize the sad truth.  It is just a stockpile for stolen metallic
dragon eggs, the dragon eggs of Paladine.  Silver, gold, bronze, copper and
brass, all are here, silent and unaware of the fate that awaits them: to
become mere footsoldiers in the Army of Takhisis.  The only sound here is
the sound of the horrible chanting from the black altar to the west.

full-grown.  Every now and again, when the horrific chanting to the east
ceases briefly, a black-robed mage will enter and place the newly created
draconian down.  All of these draconians are less than 6 hours old -- at
that age they are trained to become soldiers, and a rare few that the mages
select will become more mages, to keep the creation process, along with
Takhisis' Army, alive.

You stand in the great Meeting Hall of the Dragon Highlords.  This is
where the commanders of the Dragon Army of Takhisis come to hold audience
with their Queen and to conduct official business.  A thick, smoky haze is
all around, as is a faint but horrible odor.  The thrones are arranged about
the room, as are contingents of bodyguards.  It is difficult to see the
other end of the hall through the haze.

NAME   In front of a Highlord's Throne~
DESCR
How odd ...  There is no throne here.  Just an empty space where there
should be one.  As such, no bodyguards are here, but soldiers still crowd
into this area, just to have a little more room in this hot, humid,
stench-filled room.  But no matter where they go, they cannot escape the
ever-watching eyes of Takhisis, their one Queen.

Before you is a green throne, throne of Fewmaster Toede, Dragon Highlord.
Except now, reports have come in about his death at the hands of kender. 
This seat is open to the strongest in the Army who are willing to accept it
and the danger that comes with it ...  The danger of being assassinated in
the middle of the night by a jealous officer's soldiers.  The bodyguard
still crowds around it, unaware of what has befallen their commander.

dragonfear, assaults you as you enter, and the smell of the dragon alone
would be enough to make that fear come alive.  The only things your legs are

NAME   A smoke-filled bar~
DESCR
This makeshift bar has it all: smoke, ale, women, and drunken soldiers. 
>From the looks of it, this might be the only tavern open in the village --
but you know better.  This is just one of the more convienently located for
the soldiers who guard the temple.  You might be able to make it to the bar
if you're lucky -- and just in time to stop a fight and ask your order, here
comes a serving girl.

DESCR
You walk on a north-south road that parallels the Temple, which is to the
west.  Try as you might, the image of the foul black construction is etched
in your mind and you cannot and will never forget it.  To the north is a
place where the road intersects the eastern entrance to the Temple, and the
road continues on to the south.  A soldier's tent is to the east, and a
small house lies to the west.

NAME   Inside a tent~
DESCR
You are inside a Dragonarmy tent, hastily erected amidst the others. 
This is just one of the easily accessible, but there are others ...  There
are hundreds upon hundreds of others.  The inside of the tent is fairly
nondescript; it's a white canvas tent, with a small cot in the corner and a
small footlocker for keeping spare rations and personal belongings in.  The
entrance to the tent is back west.

This is one of the many small houses that was disrupted by the coming of
the Temple and the Dragonarmy.  Now the inhabitants cower in fear that
sometime during the night, a group of drunken soldiers will come and slay
them in a mad frenzy of bloodlust.  The fear is well-deserved, as a bar is
just to the north.

You stand beneath a rather tall stone archway, designed to honor troops
coming from the east.  However, the troops, under the command of Highlord
Lucien, never came, along with the Highlord.  Treachery is suspected, but
not certain.  To the north and south are small gates where it looks like you
can climb up into the arch itself, and the road stretches on to the east and

NAME   The mess tent~
DESCR
You are inside the massive grey mess tent, and it is indeed a mess.  Food
is strewn about chaotically, and many soldiers are eating hungrily at long
wooden tables.  You could probably sit down unnoticed and eat a meal as
well, if you could stomach the food, whatever it is.  It looks like a thin
stew made of organ meats and other nasty things.  It's even hotter in here
than it is outside.  The mess tent stretches out for quite some way to the
west, and the entrance is back to the east.

place must be getting, and then you wonder about who is making all this dust
and footprints.  Ahead, to the south, you see something dark and massive
looming on the horizon.  There is a sign here, announcing that you are on
the road to the village of Neraka.

"Road to Neraka. All of the light are hereby warned of the mortal peril that you will face to the south. Proceed no further if you value your life and your soul."
Below, there is the mark of a five-headed dragon.~

the product of the pub across the street, but it has escalated rapidly into
a full-fledged waste heap.  There's no telling what kind of diseases are
floating around in the air here.

NAME   Eastern path outside the village~
DESCR
You walk on a small dirt path outside of the village of Neraka.  Dirt and
loose stones litter the outside edge of the track.  Dust blows up and swirls
in the hot dry air, and small pebbles beat against the stone buildings and
canvas tents.  To the west lies the Temple, a beacon of despair and hatred
in the world.  To the east are a few buildings and hundreds of tents.

You stand inside a hollow shell of a building.  The back half has been
shattered, and harsh sunlight pours in.  A desk is in the back, along with a
sign.  A few signs are posted up on the walls still, the kind of signs that
a bank would have.  If this was the bank, then it was looted long ago.  The
gold and silver within probably went to fund the army.  Back to the east is
the door to the street.

This is just one of the easily accessible, but there are others ...  There
are hundreds upon hundreds of others.  The inside of the tent is fairly
nondescript; it's a white canvas tent, with a small cot in the corner and a
small footlocker for keeping spare rations and personal belongings in.  The
entrance to the tent is back north.

NAME   Southern path outside the village~
DESCR
You walk on a narrow dirt path outside the village, riddled with holes
and stones.  It is travelled significantly less than the rest of the roads
of Neraka, but they are still worn and hard.  Not much activity goes on
here, as the south seems more exposed to the elements than any other part of
the area.  The sun is hotter, the wind is stronger and the dust is drier,
but nothing can take your mind away from the Temple, leering at you like a
mirage.

well, if you could stomach the food, whatever it is.  It looks like a thin
stew made of organ meats and other nasty things.  It's even hotter in here
than it is outside.  The mess tent continues through a flap in the tent to

there's only one cook, too.  You can hear the shouts of the mess hall from
here.  This room stinks badly and is hotter still than the rest of the tent.
The "meats" that you see on small tables and in cloth sacks look more like
severed body parts and entrails than anything.  Maybe you should leave
before you get sick all over the place and the cook decides to throw that
in, too.  The doorway is back east.

never mind that -- it's not like the Army of Takhisis to leave something
like this laying around.  They're good at making things disappear -- far too
good.  There are tracks leading up to the gate and beyond it, but the gate
shows no sign of ever having been opened recently.  A high wall of stone
extends to a steep rock face to the north and south, preventing any but the
most skilled of thieves and assassins from getting past unnoticed, but the
days of necessity for that are long gone.
