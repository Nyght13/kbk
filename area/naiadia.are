In the Age of Malice while the Lord of Hate's strength increased, another
force, more powerful took root and began to grow.  Through the eyes of 
a
child the mind of a man saw the misery of the world.  Growing and maturing
in that cheerless time he was impressed into the dark order of knights that
conquered every inch of land they could see.  He fought valiantly for the
knighthood but refused to impose the suffering and torture on those he cut
down as his brothers were wont to do.  Believing in letting death give them
safety from the harshness of the world so they may be at final peace.  As
the people continued to suffer at the hands of Hate, through his knights and
demons, the young mans empathy for the fallen increased.  Believing death to
be a release, a blessed gift, to be reserved for those in pain and suffering
or as a reward for a long life, he revolted at the slaughter of the young
and innocent.  Love, through his gifts to the people, drew this man 
in
giving him the courage and hope to stand against the evil that swept 
the
land.  Facing Hate in single combat he forced the God to his knees.  As he
drew to take the final killing blow he stopped.  Feeling the 
omnipotent
being was unworthy of such a precious boon the young mortal imprisoned him
in his dark home below the earth.  The man mortally wounded in his 
trial
expired shortly after.  Love in his gratitude gave him immortal life giving
him reign over the powers that he used with such care.  Hate sat in 
the
depths of oblivion simmering and fuming at his defeat.  Constantly fighting
his bonds he manages to escape from time to time to wreak havoc on 
the
mortal land and the immortals that seek to imprison him.  Always 
seeking
revenge on the last face he sees before being forced to return to the abyss.

Peace befell the mortal world after the imprisonment of Hate.  Love
watched his children grow prosperous turning to him less and less as they
became self sufficiant.  There came a time when they resolved 
disputes
without turning to thier father.  Love was both pleased and saddened 
by
thier independence.  In his devotion decided to leave the men and elves to
thier own devices, so that they may make thier own futures and use his gifts
by thier own choosing.  Bidding farewell to his father and his children he
fell into an eternal sleep and returned to the void that created him.  Chaos
was saddened by the departure of his golden child.  Wandering the lands his
tears salted the earth, and were carried on the winds to the seas, giving
them life.  The elemental powers pitied the Lord and tried thier mightiest
to ease his burden.  A young sylph, fragile and beautiful, made from 
the
delicate summer breezes, consoled Chaos reminding him of the gifts that Love
left behind.  The lands and the seas and all they contain, all to please his
eye and his heart, reminding him that his son was still there in his
children Chaos, his spirits raised thought deeply on the words of the maid. 
Slowly in his mind a shadow emerged a swirl of light and dark.  Allowing the
shadow to take form Chaos brought forth Knowledge making him the imbodiment
of both of his eldest sons, enlightened by the powers of the dark and the
light.  Knowledge above all things sought to learn, dismissing involvement
in the mortal world other than to silently observe.  He found solace in his
books and scrolls and was constantly in search of new thoughts and ideas. 
The god took a single human to chronicle the events of the mortal world and
then locked himself away leavin his aide on his own, confidant in his
abilities.  Disappointed by the lack of interest in his brothers creations
Chaos turned from his son leaving him to his solitary pursuits.  And so ends
the Age of Malice when the worlds dreams begin to awaken.

EDESC pitfalls~
The Age of Dreams floated into existance on the winds of a summer breeze.
The Keeper of Knowledge looked over the lands of his brother finding little
that interested him.  Turning to his books and spending long hours in deep
thought the time passed by him quickly.  Slowly the stories and legends of
the lands fell upon his ears.  The jumble of words and voices distracted and
annoyed him for he noticed himself listening in hope of gaining the smallest
bit of new information.  Finding himself drawn to the mortal world once too
often to hang on a story told in the small pubs littering the landscape. 
While on one of his excursions he observed a young man frantically
scribbling in a corner of the bar while an elderly gentleman told stories to
the children.  Intrigued he peered over the youngsters shoulder and 
was
amazed to see him writing down the mans words as soon as he spoke.  Struck
by an idea he took the youth to his temple hidden just below the surface of
the earth.  Knowledge gave him a magical pen and a blank tome.  In exchange
the stripling was to write down all he heard, the bargin struck the 
god
again turned from the world to silently horde the information After 
many
years the young man began to realize that fewer and fewer stories and
legends were being told and the people were no longer learning new things. 
Worried, the disciple turned to his mentor who simply brushed him off as he
placed the latest manuscript in the huge vault occupying his temple 
and
returned to his studies.  Realizing that the Lord was taking the 
peoples
will to create and discover for his own selfish needs the adept opened the
vault determined to return learning to the world.  Throwing open the door he
was blinded by the power that lied within a churning mixture of the light
and dark.  As the power escaped it hit the boy swirled around him and found
safety in his heart.  Knowledge stripped of his possesions fell into 
his
greed and was consumed by it.  Emerging changed and devoured by his desires
the immortal settled on aquiring, hording, and protecting all he could.

This obsidian building stands out like a rose among briars in

nature, making it fit in easily.  The shield and symbol of the
Naiadian Guardsmen adorn the walls to either side of the doorway.
The business offices are functional, but slightly enchanting as
well.  The guardsmen come here to receive their orders for the
day and to unwind after their shifts.  The place seems to be alive
with a constant bustle, but no one seems to be rushed.  The lack of
serious crime on this island is apparent in the easy manner of the
guards; however, they do handle their weapons in a professional
manner.  The training facilities are state of the art and the
instructors are firm taskmasters.  Clearly this professional force
can handle any amount of trouble if the need were ever to arise.

Ivy, carefully pruned back so as not to overwhelm the flowers
growing nearby, creeps up the brick colonnades and onto the
gates themselves.  Painted white to offset the gracefully
climbing vines, the gates are handworked wrought iron, specially
treated to avoid rust in the corrosive sea air.  Although
closed at night, the gates are never locked, for the people of
Naiadia have always led an untroubled, worry-free existance.
North leads to the sea, south leads to the Center Square, east
leads to the NorthEast Quadrant and west leads to the NorthWest
Quadrant.

DESCR
A giant magnolia tree, its heady fragrance intoxicating the senses,
stands in the heart of Naiadia casting soft shadows all across the Center
Square.  It's branches sway back and forth in the gentle breeze drifting in
off the ocean, gently rocking the small swing someone attached to it.  When
the healer is free from his regular duties, he gladly pushes any small child
who wants a ride.  Despite the fact that all meeting and gatherings are held
here, the grass is always perfectly manicured and not a speck of litter can
be found anywhere.  The Square leads north, south, east and west to 
the Central Walkway.

NAME   Road in the SouthWest Quadrant~
DESCR
Anemonies, ranging in various shades of white, red and purple, lend a
lively air to the street leading around the SouthWest Quadrant.  Carefully
laid out and lovingly tended, they form the shapes of the beautiful mermaids
and handsome mermen for which the town was named.  The street itself 
is paved in brick, imported from some faraway land.  To the east is
the South gate and the road continues to the south and west.

NAME   South Gate~
DESCR
Ivy, carefully pruned back so as not to overwhelm the flowers growing
nearby, creeps up the brick colonnades and onto the gates themselves. 
Painted white to offset the gracefully climbing vines, the gates are
handworked wrought iron, specially treated to avoid rust in the corrosive
sea air.  This gate is never closed, as many couples, yearning for a 
few minutes alone, and townsfolk, seeking some exercise, enjoy taking
moonlit strolls through the beautiful gardens to the south.  North
leads to the Center Square, east leads to the SouthEast Quadrant and
west leads to the SouthWest Quadrant.

Luckily, an old sailor noticed the lack of quality drinking establishments
in the city.  Opening this tavern turned out to be the finest decision of
his life.  People fill this room constantly.  There is always a line at the
door waiting to get in.  Waitresses walk by carrying trays laden with fine
beverages.  A large bouncer sits at one end of a long teakwood and mahoganey
bar, while the bartender rushes to keep up with all the orders.  The doorway

master of his craft, is such a rare and stunning beauty that you
find yourself completely mesmerized, wondering if such perfection
of form and face could truly exist.  A small rainbow archs
gracefully over the fountain, shimmering with a magical aura.
The path leads north, south, east and west.

NAME   The Rose Garden~
DESCR
Tall and proud, a multitude of rose bushes vie for dominance in this
corner of the garden, their riotous colours sparkling brilliantly with dew. 
Even in the heat of midday, the bushes are so dense and healthy that the sun
cannot burn off the water.  Their distinct, yet delicate fragrances swirl
together to create an intoxicating aphrodesiac that stimulates the senses. 
The path leads north and west.

glade, wind their way up the tree trunks, as they lightly scent the air with
their intoxicating fragrance.  A small path leads east.
