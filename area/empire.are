You peer at thi withered old man.  His eyes are sunk back into his
sockets.  His old pale skin showing out from under his many robes.  His hair
greesy and held back with a leather strap, but you can sense a magic about
him.  Perhaps it's nothing, but he doesn't seem like he's aged a day in his
life.  S

A massive giant paces along the chamber, training the lesser oaths and citizens beneath
him in the art of warfare and of the imperial ways. He is the voice of the Emperor and
the last defense against any who comes to pry the codex from his unending vigil. Stout
and skilled at battle, the sneer that cuts across his face almost seems to welcome any
to try their hand at besting him, and stealing away his meaning in this life.

The principal concept of the Empire is to draw Thera under the
Emperor's authority, which will, in effect, rid Thera of its plague
of disorder.  Under the Emperor's reign, the chaotic influences will
be dispersed, creating order, peace, and prosperity.

The Bloodoathed, regardless of former path, are the foundation of
the Empire.  The Bloodoathing process unites them in the pursuit of
the Empire's goal.  Thus, even the Empire's greatest foes will
become part of the Empire's inevitable glorious victory.
