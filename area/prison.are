NAME   Northeast corner of the Courtyard~
DESCR
This part of the courtyard seems to have been made into some kind of
fort.  A bunch of burned wreckage has been collected and arranged in the
form of a crude wall.  Along this wall are pieces of wood and metal
sharpened to a point, a small fire burning beside it.
