blow to the powers of Legion here, but something is not quite right. Far
north at the end of the rubbled streets you can make out a large black
tower that somehow seems almost unaffected by the battle that has reduced
the rest of the region to ruins.

could have caused such destruction, and even stranger is the fact that
almost all the corpses are of Arkham forces. To the north a large black
tower stands tall above the ruins, unmarked by the battles and ominously
quiet.

NAME   On a muddy island battlefield~
DESCR
You are on a small island in the middle of Arkham's swamps. Around you there
are wooden barricades being erected for some oncoming seige upon the dark
structure to the north of the island. All around you the sounds of men yelling
and rushing about in a working frenzy can be heard. The island heads south and
west, while to the east there seems to be a wide cleared path.

NAME   Before some blasted black gates~
DESCR
You are at the entrance to what appeared to be a large fortress of town of
some kind. Now the gates of obsidian are blasted wide open by some powerful
magic and smoke rises lazily above the burning rubble. The blackened walls
head east and west around the ruins, while to the north a stone pathway heads
into the ruins and towards a towering structure at it's centre. South of here
lie the swampy grounds of the Arkham swamps.
