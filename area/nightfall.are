This massive dracolich was once one of the greatest red dragons ever to

existence.  The mortal flesh was shed and only the skeletal form was
presevered.  It's mind was then gathered from the shadows and reinstituted
into the new form, allowing It to once again walk the mortal planes as a
major free-willed undead.  Now it serves as It's lord's main form of
transport, enjoying the privilages it gets from such a duty.

NAME   A small underground pool~
DESCR
You stumble out into a broad open cavern.  Some of your light shines on a
pool of water that lies here stagnant and uninviting.  On closer inspection
you realise that the water isn't actually water but thinned out blood that's
seeped from the ceiling and walls to form a sticky wet puddle.

NAME   Antechamber to the shadowlord's room~
DESCR
This darkened room reminds you of a crypt.  Nothing stirs, not even the
wind, and even cries of agony and despair seem muted and far off.  Statues
of the many of the greater demons and devils of the Abyss' 666 layers have
been erected here: Orcus, Demogorgon, Pazuzus, Asmodeus, Bael, Molok and
others stare back at you with such intensity you feel yourself cringing.  A
landing lies south and to the east a door blocks the way but not the
prescence of something unspeakable.
