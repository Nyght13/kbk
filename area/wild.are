DESCR
A stout humanoid figure crouches before you, examining some fresh tracks
near his feet. The cowl that hides his face is covered with small twigs,
leaves, and several blades of grass. He grips a long wooden staff in his
right hand that appears to be tied to his forearm by thin leather straps.
His oddly decorated armor reminds you of a tiger, only the colors are
reversed. As he slowly stands erect, his face comes into full view. Dangling
from his chin is a long wiry beard, though his cheeks are perfectly smooth.
His gaze is allusive, constantly studying everything around him.

here for a specific reason, though you know not what.  To presume that she
would be an easy opponent to defeat would be a grave mistake.

north. The dried up fountain in the center of the garden is covered in dust
and dead leaves. Small gardening tools appear to be scattered around your
feet, most of them deteriorated and barely recognizable. To the east and
west you can see the outer boundries of the Wild Wood. To the north there
lies a small path into the darkness.

entryway as does severed body parts. A slow but repetitious creaking sound
can be heard from inside the hut. You squint to try and look inside, but to
no avail. Fallen trees and dense undergrowth have blocked your path to the
north and west. To the south is Wild Wood. The entrance to the hut lies to

NAME   Inside the Bloody Hut~
DESCR
You slip and slide across the blood-covered floor. As you regain your
balance, you almost trip over a dismembered corpse floating haphazardly
around the room. The grim faces of the slain victims stare at you from every
direction, each telling you a different suffering bestowed upon them before
death. A small child is impaled on the eastern wall with what appears to be
the bone from his father's leg. No two were tortured in the same way. Half
of a woman hangs dangling from the ceiling and the other half, split yet
again, lies on each side of the table. The rope sings a chilling tune as it
sways. This is a sickening sight indeed. To the west leads you back outside
into the forest.

NAME   Surrounding a Black Cauldron~
DESCR
Dead trees, scattered like toothpicks, line the forest floor around a
rather large black iron cauldron. Beneath the cauldron is a magical fire of
black flame snapping and flickering as though it knows that you have come.
Hundreds of glowing eyes glare at you from just within the depths of the
darkness. Around your feet lie large pieces of flesh. Each piece depicts a
different set of runes that have been carved into them. A gurgling murmur
from within the cauldron draws your attention back towards the center of the
area. To the south you see the Wild Wood.

NAME   On the Bone Pile~
DESCR
In the center of this large open space is a huge pile of bones. Some
bones are still whole, where others have been gnawed upon and splintered.
Various kinds of skulls lie within the pile. The stench of rotting flesh
puts you on the edge of vomitting as you gag more than once. A half-eaten
dead elf rolls down from the top of the pile towards you. His intestines get
caught in a dwarf's ribcage making him look like a rolling ball of yarn,
with his guts trailing after him. A deep sucking sound oozes from the corpse
as it hits the ground at your feet.

The plants move closer and closer. There is no light here. It has been
totally blocked out by the dark canopy of foliage above you. You feel very
unsafe here. Fallen trees and dense undergrowth have blocked your path to
the south. To the north, east and west is Wild Wood.

NAME   A Desolate Shrine~
DESCR
Eight weathered pillars encircle a center stone slab within this
partially cleared meadow. On the slab, there is a large ivory statue of a
kneeling woman, untouched by time, reaching for the sky with one arm, while
her other hand appears to be shoved into the ground before her. Her
expressionless face seems more lifelike than any statue you have ever seen
before. Two giant stone beasts crouch respectively on either side of the
altar. Each stares attentively at the statue between them. Unlike the forest
surrounding you on all sides, this small humble shrine seems to be well
tended and free of any evil taint. To the north you see the Wild Wood.

of a city. To the east you can see a magnificent tree bursting through the
forest almost reaching the heavens. To the west there is an opening into the
briar patch.
