EDESC red seal parchment~
This piece of paper talks about the blood letting of the elves and the use of
their blood to raise the evil that has spread from the ancient city of Myth
Drannor. It describes the way that the blood was collected in a tower and used
to fuel the burning fires of hell, and how the mages and clerics were corrupted
in order to provide the power to initiate the rising. Blue, for the pure energy
of magic-users, and green, for the life giving powers of nature and clerics,
constitue the other two colours of power involved in the raising of the great
power that resides here. Once the red, blue and green are finally
joined the black tower will reveal it's secrets..

NAME   Entrance to the Red Tower~
DESCR
You are standing at the bottom of a wide stone stairwell. The walls around you
are bathed in a bloody red colour that looks like freshly splashed blood, yet
which could not possibly be such after so long a time. A chilling rapsing sound
can be heard from above, along with the familiar noises of chinking armor and
rattling weapons. A door of red tinged stone lies in the east wall.

NAME   In a blood red room~
DESCR
You stand in the middle of a huge room coated in what looks like sticky red
blood. However, no bodies or signs of battle are evident and the red does not
drip off the walls. A cold, almost freezing, chill hangs in the air and the
sound of metal on metal can be heard from elsewhere in the tower. You can make
out stairs to the north, east, south and west.

You have walked into a rounded battlement of the tower drenched in wet blood.
The red colour washes away all signs of the stone beneath it and it is almost
impossible to believe that so much blood could be shed in one place. Despite
all the blood there is no sign of bodies and it appears to be just coating
everything but not drying. There are small parapets on the battlements to the
north, east, south and west.
