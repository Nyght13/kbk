LONG  A small, spotted dragon lies here, looking at you through lazy eyes.
~
DESCR
He is a decent sized dragon, around 20 feet in height/length. You can't
exactly make out what type of dragon he is, because his spots are not like
any you have seen before. He spurts a little fire from his nose, yawns, and
stretches out before you.

SHORT a draconian gate guard~
LONG  A tall draconian figure stands here guarding the gate.
~
DESCR
His muscles ripple as he clenches his sword tightly, barring passage to those
who wish to hurt the dragons. He has sworn to protect them and that he has 
done so far. Long black hair flows down past his shoulders, knotting in places
and stuck together with dried blood in others. One thing you gather is that he
will protect the Towers with his life.

NAME  Tiamat dragon~
SHORT Tiamat~
LONG  An enormous five-headed dragon stands here, each of it's heads hissing.
~
DESCR
She is the power behind this very large tower. The oldest among the dragons
and probably the strangest looking, she gained power through cheating, 
treachery, lies and murder. Of course, the five heads, each with a distinct
difference, give her alot of her strength, as well. None of the draconian  
guardians know how or why with Tiamat. Only that she now controls them..

EDESC letter~
Dear Kinsdragon,
How is life serving the great Lady of Magic? Surely not as
interesting as guarding a hidden hoard within the Tower of
the Dragons. I brag this day because I have done a perfectly
evil thing, and nobody ever comes around to visit and hear of
my evil deeds.
Recently a mage wandered in, one not devoted to any of the
gods nor goddess, and saw the ancient tome I guard, the
Ancient Grimoire of the True Dragons. It is, of course,
written in the tongue of our people. This mage seemed to
have some knowledge of our tongue, for he read through some
of it, got an excited look on his face, and asked me politely
if he could translate it for his own use, leaving me the
original.
He amused me, Shadows, so I let him live and work in the


safety of my wing and breath. All who entered were toasted
or roasted, and sometimes we ate well although if his own
kind ended up dead on the floor he did not dine with me.
When he finished his copy of the Ancient Grimoire of the
True Dragons, I asked to see his translation. It was a very
good rendering of the Old Tongue.
Suffice it to say, translator mages are very delicious.
Wish you had been here to share the victuals. I trust
the elf-Lady keeps you well-fed?
Deep-Shadow
Tower of the Dragons
P.S.--Send the messenger who bears this scroll to visit our
kinsdragon Garna. He stole a trinket of mine when he thought
I wasn't looking, the fool. Garna will return it if she
values her life after enjoying elf-meat.

EDESC grimoire translation~
This is all I managed to translate from ancient texts found while
searching for a way to enhance our magic to such strength that it
would defy spellbane utterly, as well as counter some of the twisted
magics used by the killers who call themselves Ancient. I had heard
a rumor in childhood which led me to believe the dragons of old had
the answer, so I wandered the Tower and found this ancient tome
within the greedy grasp of an evil shadow dragon. The dragon was kind
enough to let me stay and translate. This is my translation copy,
which I will probably share with draconian mages, as I know it will
feed upon some of their desires.
REVERSION MAGIC: Spell to undo the process of turning dragon into
part-hominid/part-dragon (called by commoners draconians). The spell
requires various reagents in specific quantities.
To revert a draconian to dragon form it is *absolutely necessary* to
gain 10 scales of a true dragon the same color as the draconian to
be reverted.
In addition, various colors of draconians will require different
reagents to revert them to the right color true dragon. Failure to
use the proper reagent will result in the draconian being exploded,
its soul so decimated it cannot re-congeal into another mortal shell.
For a red draconian, a bit of fire is required. Best results have
come from the use of a ring of fire. 
A green draconian's reversion will require something poisonous. In
the margin of the original Grimoire were words penned in somewhat
slanted: 'hydrocyanic acid' (?)
A blue draconian requires the aid of nature's electricity. A very
powerful implement which sets off a chain reaction of lightning bolts
works best for the blue. Mere single bolts from lesser wands have 
caused the premature death of the blue desiring reversion.
The reversion of a white draconian requires something powerful which
sucks in the heat of the Light, leaving Shadow and coldness. In the
margin words penned at a slant read: 'ring of ice' (?)
Black draconians require something that eats away at metals. Very
powerful acids are to be found in the world but are well-guarded. 
Slaves have lost their lives in retrieval of such things as hydro-
fluoric acid.
IN ADDITION to the scales and special reagents, the draconian
requesting the reversion needs a specially brewed reagent. It is
said that only the Lady's chosen among the great learned ArchMages of
the world are capable of creating such brews. Not everything an
ArchMage brews will work, however. Experience has shown that these
items when brewed serve best for the reversion spell:
Harp of Dragonsong
Ring of Dragons
Dragon Crest signet ring
Ring of the Diamond Dragon
They must be brewed under specific circumstances, also. One very
important requirement often skimped upon (and if not done this
way, the whole reversion spell turns into an annihilation of the
draconian wishing reversion), is that the ArchMage must brew the
object within the view of the powerful one who will work the
reversion magic. While successful reversions have occurred under
the watchful eyes of a mortal mage, more often than not the mortal
has not the strength needed to command the magical weave. If a god
would watch over the reversion, it has a better chance of succeeding.
Dragon magic being very powerful, it is advised that weak gods, no
matter how evil, not be asked to oversee the process. They have
been known to ruin the entire thing and leave the draconian crippled
or worse, because they are not powerful enough to weave the magic
necessary to work with the draconic reagents. It is said that long
ago Elminster once wove the magic for a reversion, and barely
succeeded. The resulting true dragon had scales that would not
polish to a fine lustre, and his breath did not proceed from his maw
beyond the length of an average gnome, thus limiting him to 'in-your-
face' combat. His wings were also mangled, making him aerodynamically
unsound and therefore landbound.
Succeed in mixing all these necessary ingredients in a cauldron of
obsidian, and have all the powerful magics necessary nearby, and the
reversion spell should not fail.

NAME   Around the Dining Table~
DESCR
As you progress around this very large table, you notice many fine wines and
foods, some of which you sample, that originate from around the world. The
Draconian King probably hopes this display of wealth will impress any of the
visiting guests. You notice all the chairs at this table have been removed,
giving you the impressing that it is more like a buffet table, rather than a
fancy dining room. To the northeast you notice the King's throne.

NAME   The Throne~
DESCR
Great scales of ancient dragons adorned with jewels of the finest quality 
form the enormous throne before you. Cushioned with pillows so that the king
is more comfortable, it radiates high quality. From this particular part of 
the room, you can see why the king's negotiating skills are to be reckoned 
with. The throne is raised a bit higher than the rest of the chairs, giving 
the king a strategic look of great importance.

to keep any scratches or disruptions in the wall from being permanent. To the
east the clouds of smoke are a little less dense.

Dark storm clouds can be seen about here since the roof of this grand lair 
has been removed. The lair of Tiamat is truely extraordinary. From this 
height you can see all of the Shadow Grove below you, making you dizzy from 
it's strange randomness. Lightning crackles and strikes the side of the tower
shaking it and knocking a few bones loose of a pile in the corner. The lair
itself seems to have been flown up here, rather than built or carved from 
stone, since it's make up is truely magical in nature. The walls themselves
vibrate with strange energy around you, filling your soul with a strange
feeling.
