A barbarian sits on a stool before you, staring intently at the forge.

Muscled in every area possible, this behemoth challenges the other

|2.  Magical items of any nature are strictly forbidden.  (Items of the|

|    something magical.  If you are unsure about an item, ask one of   |

NAME   A muddy track~
DESCR
Water from the waterfall to the east has drained onto this path, changing
what would have otherwise been dirt into thick mud.  Multitudes of deep
footprints create grooves within the muddy surface, making it apparent that
this hidden path is often trudged upon.  Fields of tall, swaying grass line
either side of the track, and trees can be seen in the distance to the north
and south.  To the west, the mud ends abruptly and a field of grass begins,
and in the distance, what appear to be a number of huts dot the landscape. 
A sound reminiscent of clashing metal echoes throughout the fields.

Grass has slowly overgrown and overrun this section of the east-west

movement.  Lining either side of the grassy path-like field are
significantly taller grass and occasional trees.  Towards the east, the
grass fades onto a muddy path.  Westward, a small gate gives way to an
arrangement of primitive huts.  The sound of clashing metal echoes loudly
from the village to the west and from a massive hut in the distant south,
unreachable from here due to the overgrowth.

to be wide open, allowing easy access into and out of the village.  The
advance of the grass from the east ends here, giving way to a wide area of
dirt and pebbles.  Spread out towards the west upon a wide dirt path are a
number of man-made huts, occupied by the barbarians inhabitants of the
village.  Some barbarians roam the village, carrying resources such as
firewood, meat, water, and even full-grown dead cattle, while others still
spar within the village perimeter.  Towards the east, a grassy field
blankets the landscape.  Southward, the entrance to a large hut, spewing
smoke from a hole in the roof, stands.  Towards the north, the entrance to a

hooks on the walls as trophies of barbarian victory.  The floor is composed
of rough dirt and rock, stained red with dried blood near the walls as a
result of dripping blood from the barbarian trophies.  Barbarians enter the
hut periodically to hang another body part on the walls, admire the
surroundings briefly, and leave as quickly as they came.  The exit to the
hut is towards the south.

bonfire site in the middle of the village, where barbarians carry out
ceremonies and customary rituals.  In the center of the bonfire site, a
smooth and massive iron pillar protrudes from the ground high into the air. 
To the north, a rune-covered arch stands before a hut where wounded
barbarians appear to enter and be relieved of their injuries.  Southward an
expanse of empty space is laid out.  The sound of intense combat rings out
from the dirt field, and a stench of blood attacks the nostrils.  Towards
the west, a hut stands taller than any other in the entire village.  The
entrance is adorned with a large number of impaled heads and skulls lie on
the ground before it.

Loud clanging fills the air here.  The hot air is thick and dry, and
smoke spills out from towards the east.  Shattered weapons and armor, as
well as other indiscernable objects, of various materials litter the ground
here, forcing visitors' steps to be meticulous and well-placed.  Contrasting
the chaotic mess that has befallen the room, however, deadly weapons of
great make adorn the walls in well-fashioned sheaths and cases.  From the
east, an aura of immense heat and smoke permeates and the clanging noises
reminiscent of a hammer grow ever louder.

An immense heat fills this room, emanating from a primitively-crafted
steel forge.  Bright red rocks fill the forge and emit large amounts of
smoke, most of which escapes into the sky through a well-placed hole in the
ceiling over the forge.  Despite the hole, however, some smoke lingers,
making the already thick, hot air even more difficult to breathe.  The walls
are charred, black, and bare as a result of the heat and smoke.  A barbarian
weaponsmith stands near the forge, making a living by tempering weapons of
every sort for the rest of the village to use.

The wide expanse of dirt here is covered in both dried and wet blood.  In
the center of the square, a behemoth of a barbarian stands unopposed,
challenging the other barbarians to test their strength against him in live
combat.  Other barbarians fight to determine the superior elsewhere in the
square.  Towards the west end of the field, a pile of corpses lie rotting,
giving testament to those who were unprepared and defeated in combat. 
Swords and other weapons also litter the ground, left behind by those who
have fled and dishonored themselves.  The sounds of clashing swords can be
heard all around and also towards the north, where the village square lies.

DESCR
Barbarians roam this room in an almost zombie-like fashion.  As one
wounded barbarian enters, a healthy one leaves.  A line of barbarians stands
in front of a robed human near the end of the room who is in deep
concentration, apparently healing wounds.  The rest of the hut is rather
plainly decorated, with the exception of medicinal herbs and bandages strewn
about the floor occasionally.  An altar erected behind the healer indicates
that this hut is a shrine of some kind.  You can return to the village
square to the south.

NAME   The Shrine of Skulls~
DESCR
The walls of this massive hut are covered with dried blood and bones
litter the ground.  The floor is stained red with the blood of intruders and
traitors.  True to the Shrine's name, skulls and impaled heads cover the
ground here like grains of sand.  In the center of the room, the village's
greatest warrior, the Destructor, stands guarding the gruesome head of
Thera's greatest sorcerer, impaled upon a well-adorned silver pike.  The
rest of the village lies back to the east.
