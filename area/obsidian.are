NAME   An Obsidian Tunnel~
DESCR
This smooth tunnel appears to be made of pure obsidian.  A dull light
illuminates it, but you cannot pinpoint the exact source.  Ahead of you the
tunnel abruptly pitches downward into blackness, and you get the feeling
that going further might just be a very dangerous step.  
warning you.  Read it!  
 
A sign stands here, warning you. Read it!

The sign reads as follows:
This is a very dangerous area. Without a large, powerful group, you _will_
die. Once you go forward, there's only one way out, and it's past 5 devils.
All keys are rot_death, so unlock and move fast. Good luck!

NAME   Before the Gates of the Obsidian Palace~
DESCR
As you fall to the ground roughly, you look ahead and cannot help
yourself from gaping.  Ahead of you is undoubtedly the largest structure you
have ever seen, pure black, seemingly carved out of the stone around it. 
The gothic turrets and parapaces seem to go on forever, but the huge tower
in the very center of the Palace catches your eye.  Up ahead are the Gates. 
Then again, perhaps you're not welcome.

Two huge black gates rise before you, almost higher than the eye can see.
A tiny keyhole seems the only way to gain access to the gates.  As you
approach, however, your gawking is interrupted by the two guards dressed in
pure black armor who scream at you and charge.

NAME   Inside the Obsidian Palace~
DESCR
As you step inside, you notice that you seem to be in some sort of foyer.
Everything follows the same pure black motif, even the extravagant
furniture.  Everything here speaks of untold wealth, but for some reason,
you feel like grabbing and stuffing it all in your pockets might just be a
very bad idea.  The foyer widens ahead into some sort of wide open area.

NAME   The Throne Room~
DESCR
Stepping forward, you gape in awe at what must be an optical illusion, as
a room far too large to fit inside what you observed from the outside of the
Palace stands before you.  Directly ahead of you are wide steps carved out
of the black glass that makes up this building, leading up to a dais
containing a jagged black throne large enough to seat five people side by
side.  It appears empty, and you can only wonder where the owner is. 
Beneath you, you see a circular staircase leading down into dark oblivion.

As you take your first step onto the dais, you look behind you and

upwards, out of sight.

Stepping before the huge throne, you notice a soft rumbling that rapidly

their ultimate destination can't be seen.

You stand on a platform of black in a sea of red flame.  All around you,
you hear growling noises and screams.  This moment of safety may be your
last.  Behind you the stairs go back, but for going forward your only path
seems to be help from the man in front of you.

The platform grinds to a halt.  You instinctively step off it moments
before it plunges into the abyss.  The only way out is through the huge
devil standing in your path, and only the tortured soul that he holds will
open a way out of this hell.

The huge black circle you step into radiates evil.  This is where the

happy to see you.  There seems to be a portal of inky blackness in the

This tower, by some feat of magic, stretches out as far as the eye can
see.  You are in the center of a huge crimson pentagram that appears to be
made up of pure blood.  Strong winds gust over the surface, nearly making
you lose your balance.  The ruler of this Palace intends to make a sacrifice
to his God in exchange for unspeakable power, and it's rapidly becoming
clear...  The sacrifice is you.
