NAME  fire giant efreeti~
SHORT The Fire Elemental Efreeti~
LONG  (Surrounded by Flames) An incredibly large, mean-looking giant stands here growling.
~
DESCR
A large column of massive flames swirl around a large man's body, a man 
who appears to be a Giant.  This Giant is very muscular-broadened shoulder, 
immense arm strength, kicks like a bull- as well as skilled. His eyes are 
a fierce yellow, seeming as though they have a pulse themselves, 
concentrated upon seeking your death.

NAME  unholy mage giant magician~
SHORT The Unholy Magician~
LONG  (Black Aura) Enraged by your entrance, an Unholy mage unleashes his darkness upon you.
~
DESCR
Before you stands an awe-inspiring figure.  He is obviously a fire giant 
by heritage, but has a similar build to that of a tree trunk.  At first 
glance you conceive that his battle prowess must be unparalleled.  As you 
continue to study the Unholy Magician you come upon his aged eyes.  These 
eyes seem to contain a depth and understanding that almost seem impossible, 
however somewhere in that depth you sense a dark foreboding chaos present that 
sends shivers down your spine.
