NAME   A dark trail~
DESCR
The trees all around you howl as you walk on this dark and lonely trail.  
Leaves swirl in tornadoes and the wind tears at your clothing, making you 
want badly to rest on a nearby tree stump. High above dark clouds thunder  
and lightning crackles. You notice further to the north that the trail 
begins to ascend into the mountains.

NAME   A dark trail~
DESCR
The forest that once surrounded this trail seems less dense in this part. 
Rocks and boulders rest around you and loose dirts slides down the path  
leading up the mountain. Large howls from mountain wolves can be heard in  
the distance, though no direction can be guessed which way it actually 
originated from. To the south the trail continues while you may climb up 
the mountain here.

The trail that leads around this mountain is very rocky and the loose dirt 
makes it increasingly difficult to walk. Few trees surround this trail and 
speckle the landscape below. Mostly pine, you notice that none have grown 
very well. The dark clouds above may be the reason, although you wonder what 
could be causing the constant darkness.

NAME   the clearing~
DESCR
Like the mountain above, the rocks here are scattered about the area. The 
clearing seems to look almost like the beginnings of a road leading north, 
where you notice a large town surrounded by an iron wall. You notice the 
weather above and around the town is just as it was leading here: cloudy  
and dark, although the mountains seem to look more inviting.

NAME   The south gate~
DESCR
At the gate of Varggin Shih you can already see the despair and darkness 
present in this city. An awful smell wafts in with the wind, making you 
gasp for fresh air. Heaps of dirty furs litter the inside of the gate, most
likely for trade (although you aren't sure who would by such filthy things). 
The gate and the walls surrounding the city tower at a height close to around 
twenty feet.

The street, like anything you see around you, smells. A dim glow illuminates 
the area from an unknown source. Various grunts and howls can be heard coming 
from the many homes that you see lining the street. You notice that there 
was some fur tossed to the side of the road, most likely the source of the 
horrid smell.

throw waste and other things. Other than the blood stains covering the walls

NAME   A Small Home~
DESCR
This small home is large enough for one, maybe two trolls at most. It is 
pretty basic in it's furnishing: a bed, a kitchen/dining room "area" where  
a large table is, and a large hole in the floor where you assume the trolls
throw waste and other things. Other than the blood stains covering the walls  
and carpet, this is exactly what an every-day troll would love.

from the many homes that you see lining the street. You notice that there
was some fur tossed to the side of the road, most likely the source of the 
horrid smell.

NAME   Entrance to a Palace~
DESCR
Gold glitters around you and you feel out of place in this glorious foyer 
to the palace of the Varggin Shih. Paintings and murals depicting the 
history of this city hang in the hall, leaving you in awe and feeling  
almost out of place from the dark and lonely streets to the south. Torches 
hang in jewel-hilted sconces lighting the palace with a warm glow.

NAME   the Hallway~
DESCR
The palace is in much better condition than the rest of the city and you 
wonder how the citizens put up with the king. To the south the entrance glows 
with radiance and you almost question the fact that a troll lives here. To 
the east a strange smell emits from the darkness.

NAME   The Shaman's Room~
DESCR
This room is very dark and cold, lit only by a single torch that emits no 
heat. The walls are so black that it is difficult to discern exactly where 
they are. You can hear a low, moaning wind echoing from somewhere, carrying 
with it the faint whimpers much like that of a dying child, but the air here 
is dead, stale and lifeless, and there is no breeze to be felt.

No torches line this hallway and the glow from the south seems not as

battles adorn the walls, which are made of the blackest of onyx. To the north  
there is a large throne room where the king resides. To the south the palace 
extends.

DESCR
A raised dais occupoes the center of this dismal place, and on the dais
is a throne, constructed from countless humanoid bones and upholstered  
with human skin that still drips blood, creating small crimson pools on the  
smooth black marble floor that drains into a series of grates surrounding the
throne.
