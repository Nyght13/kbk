mortal form. Uteroi is engraved at the very top in a crimson color while

The Uteroi is only for the strong willed. Any else risk death.

NAME   Outside the Ancient Citadel~
DESCR
As if clawing its way from the earth, enormous slivers of rusted iron
rise from the ground in a dome like pattern around this ancient sanctuary. 
A path of scorched, scathing bones form entrance into the inner circle.  A
broad shouldered figure of immense size and strength, cloaked in black,
guards the entrance.

NAME   Along the Ritual Path~
DESCR
A wide path of burning bone and embers leads towards the inner sanctum of
the Ancients.  The edges of the path are blocked by adamantite statues, each
carved with its head bowed and griping the hand of a brethren, therefore
blocking escape.  Ahead one can see the circular temple, where the Ancients
gather.

NAME   Within the Citadel of the Ancients~
DESCR
This circular temple is enclosed by shards and slivers of rusted iron
which claw upward from the earth and meet at a center ring high above.  In
the center of the citadel is a large urn, surrounded by a complex system of
ducts, which seem to contain blood.  Behind that is another hooded figure,
which however disguised, appears to be a priest of some kind.  Along the
southern edge of the citadel is a pit in which lies an altar.

wall.  Small creatures scuttle about sliding in an out of the shadows. 
Every now and then, a scream rings out from the distance, perhaps a
sacrifice for the Dark One being carried out.

altar made of obsidian, and its guardian.  Surrounding all of this are the
many bones of its intruders and anyone else the Ancients find to be
sacrilegious to their cause.

BELOW ARE THE GUIDELINES FOR THE ANCIENT CABAL:
-----------------------------------------------
 
1) Should you use another character to place bounties so you can
collect them, you will find yourself homeless very soon.
 
2) Do not gang (3 or more people) anyone unless they do have a 
bounty on their life.
 
3) Killing among the cabal is frowned upon and the Leader may take
action upon those who PK their cabal mates.
 
4) Bounty-stealing is a good way to get the Ancient Immortals as
well as your cabal mates pissed off at you. If someone has a bounty
hurt don't time your strike to steal their point.
 
5) The Leader of Ancient shall always be the individual with the
most bounty kills.

NAME   The Crimson Room~
DESCR
Decorated entirely in crimson, from the walls, ceiling and floor,
to the scant furniture placed asymeterically throughout, this room
sends a shiver down your spine as you sense death is but a breath
away.  Here and there, you can just barely discern old bloodstains
against the blooded reds of the room.  Weapons of every conceivable
type, and some quite unimagineable, line the walls like trophies.

This large chasm is formed of a massive crack in the obsidian rock.  The
only light provided is from the sacred torch of the ancients.  Standing in
dead silence behind the sacred torch is a still decomposing lich, which
forever guards the item.
