A message is inscribed on this essence of Victory. At first glance, its language escapes you. As you
finish inspecting the weapon, a voice whispers in the back of your head...
 
"I am the hand of victory," it whispers. "I bend to the will of my wielder, and become the
harbinger of destruction to the enemy. There exists no defeat, for holding me, the earth trembles
and quivers in fear."
 
The voice fades and grows distant, leaving you only with one final, audible whisper...
