This is the source code for Kill or be Killed (KBK), posMUD, and/or Duel Grounds.

No additional license is placed on this code by the authors. The original DIKU,
Merc, ROM, and Tartarus license(s) apply.

I've restored the orignal doc/ folder from the stock Tartarus distribution and
updated the source to include proper credits and notices at the top of each file.
